<div class="calibre1"><a class="calibre5"></a><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre4">SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">New York scares Salim, and so he clutches his sample case protectively with both hands, holding it to his chest. He is scared of black people, the way they stare at him, and he is scared of the Jews-the ones dressed all in black with hats and beards and side curls he can identify, and how many others that he cannot-he is scared of the sheer quantity of the people, all shapes and sizes of people, as they spill from their high, high, filthy buildings onto the sidewalks; he is scared of the honking hullabaloo of the traffic, and he is even scared of the air, which smells both dirty and sweet, and nothing at all like the air of Oman.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Salim has been in New York, in America, for a week. Each day he visits two, perhaps three different offices, opens his sample case, shows them the copper trinkets, the rings and bottles and tiny flashlights, the models of the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, the Eiffel Tower, gleaming in copper inside; each night he writes a fax to his brother-in-law, Fuad, at home in Muscat, telling him that he has taken no orders, or, on one happy day, that he had taken several orders (but, as Salim is painfully aware, not yet enough even to cover his airfare and hotel bill).</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">For reasons Salim does not understand, his brother-in-law's business partners have booked him into the Paramount Hotel on 46th Street. He finds it confusing, claustrophobic, expensive, alien.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Fuad is Salim's sister's husband. He is not a rich man, but he is the co-owner of a small trinket factory. Everything is made for export, to other Arab countries, to Europe, to America. Salim has been working for Fuad for six months. Fuad scares him a little. The tone of Fuad's faxes is becoming harsher. In the evening, Salim sits in his hotel room, reading his Qur'an, telling himself that this will pass, that his stay in this strange world is limited and finite.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">His brother-in-law gave him a thousand dollars for miscellaneous traveling expenses and the money, which seemed so huge a sum when first he saw it, is evaporating faster than Salim can believe. When he first arrived, scared of being seen as a cheap Arab, he tipped everyone, handing extra dollar bills to everyone he encountered; and then he decided that he was being taken advantage of, that perhaps they were even laughing at him, and he stopped tipping entirely.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">On his first and only journey by subway he got lost and confused, and missed his appointment; now he takes taxis only when he has to, and the rest of the time he walks. He stumbles into overheated offices, his cheeks numb from the cold outside, sweating beneath his coat, shoes soaked by slush; and when the winds blow down the avenues (which run from north to south, as the streets run west to east, all so simple, and Salim always knows where to face Mecca) he feels a cold on his exposed skin that is so intense it is like being struck.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He never eats at the hotel (for while the hotel bill is being covered by Fuad's business partners, he must pay for his own food); instead he buys food at falafel houses and at little food stores, smuggles it up to the hotel beneath his coat for days before he realizes that no one cares. And even then he feels strange about carrying the bags of food into the dimly lit elevators (Salim always has to bend and squint to find the button to press to take him to his floor) and up to the tiny white room in which he stays.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Salim is upset. The fax that was waiting for him when he woke this morning was curt, and alternately chiding, stem, and disappointed: Salim was letting them down-his sister, Fuad, Fuad's business partners, the Sultanate of Oman, the whole Arab world. Unless he was able to get the orders, Fuad would no longer consider it his obligation to employ Salim. They depended upon him. His hotel was too expensive. What was Salim doing with their money, living like a sultan in America? Salim read the fax in his room (which has always been too hot and stifling, so last night he opened a window, and was now too cold) and sat there for a time, his face frozen into an expression of complete misery.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Then Salim walks downtown, holding his sample case as if it contained diamonds and rubies, trudging through the cold for block after block until, on Broadway and 19th Street, he finds a squat building over a deli. He walks up the stairs to the fourth floor, to the office of Panglobal Imports.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The office is dingy, but he knows that Panglobal handles almost half of the ornamental souvenirs that enter the U.S. from the Far East. A real order, a significant order from Panglobal, could redeem Salim's journey, could make the difference between failure and success, so Salim sits on an uncomfortable wooden chair in an outer office, his sample case balanced on his lap, staring at the middle-aged woman with her hair dyed too bright a red who sits behind the desk, blowing her nose on Kleenex after Kleenex. After she blows her nose she wipes it, and drops the Kleenex into the trash.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Salim got there at 10:30 A.M., half an hour before his appointment. Now he sits there, flushed and shivering, wondering if he is running a fever. The time ticks by so slowly.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Salim looks at his watch. Then he clears his throat.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The woman behind the desk glares at him. "Yes?" she says. It sounds like Yed.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It is eleven-thirty-five," says Salim.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The woman glances at the clock on the Wall, and says, "Yed," again. "Id id."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"My appointment was for eleven," says Salim with a placating smile.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Mister Blanding knows you're here," she tells him, reprovingly. ("Bidter Bladdig dode you're here.")</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Salim picks up an old copy of the New York Post from the table. He speaks English better than he reads it, and he puzzles his way through the stories like a man doing a crossword puzzle. He waits, a plump young man with the eyes of a hurt puppy, glancing from his watch to his newspaper to the clock on the wall.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">At twelve-thirty several men come out from the inner office. They talk loudly, jabbering away to each other in American. One of them, a big, paunchy man, has a cigar, unlit, in his mouth. He glances at Salim as he comes out. He tells the woman behind the desk to try the juice of a lemon, and zinc as his sister swears by zinc and vitamin C. She promises him that she will, and gives him several envelopes. He pockets them and then he, and the other men, go out into the hall. The sound of their laughter disappears down the stairwell.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It is one o'clock. The woman behind the desk opens a drawer and takes out a brown paper bag, from which she removes several sandwiches, an apple, and a Milky Way. She also takes out a small plastic bottle of freshly squeezed orange juice.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Excuse me," says Salim, "but can you perhaps call Mister Blanding and tell him that I am still waiting?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She looks up at him as if surprised to see that he is still there, as if they have not been sitting five feet apart for two and a half hours. "He's at lunch," she says. He'd ad dudge.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Salim knows, knows deep down in his gut, that Blanding was the man with the unlit cigar. "When will he be back?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She shrugs, takes a bite of her sandwich. "He's busy with appointments for the rest of the day," she says. He'd biddy wid abboidmeds for the red ob the day.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Will he see me, then, when he comes back?" asks Salim.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She shrugs, and blows her nose.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Salim is hungry, increasingly so, and frustrated, and powerless.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">At three o'clock the woman looks at him and says "He wode be gubbig bag."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Excuse?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Bidder Bladdig. He wode be gubbig bag today."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Can I make an appointment for tomorrow?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She wipes her nose. "You hab to teddephode. Appoid-beds odly by teddephode."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I see," says Salim. And then he smiles: a salesman, Fuad had told him many times before he left Muscat, is naked in America without his smile. "Tomorrow I will telephone," he says. He takes his sample case, and he walks down the many stairs to the street, where the freezing rain is turning to sleet. Salim contemplates the long, cold walk back to the 46th Street hotel, and the weight of the sample case, then he steps to the edge of the sidewalk and waves at every yellow cab that approaches, whether the light on top is on or off, and every cab drives past him.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">One of them accelerates as it passes; a wheel dives into a water-filled pothole, spraying freezing muddy water over Salim's pants and coat. For a moment, he contemplates throwing himself in front of one of the lumbering cars, and then he realizes that his brother-in-law would be more concerned with the fate of the sample case than of Salim himself, and that he would bring grief to no one but his beloved sister, Fuad's wife (for he had always been a slight embarrassment to his father and mother, and his romantic encounters had always, of necessity, been both brief and relatively anonymous): also, he doubts that any of the cars are going fast enough actually to end his life.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A battered yellow taxi draws up beside him and, grateful to be able to abandon his train of thought, Salim gets in.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The backseat is patched with gray duct tape; the half-open Plexiglas barrier is covered with notices warning him not to smoke, telling him how much to pay to get to the various airports. The recorded voice of somebody famous he has never heard of tells him to remember to wear his seat belt.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"The Paramount Hotel, please," says Salim.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The cabdriver grunts and pulls away from the curb, into the traffic. He is unshaven, and he wears a thick, dust-colored sweater and black plastic sunglasses. The weather is gray, and night is falling: Salim wonders if the man has a problem with his eyes. The wipers smear the street scene into grays and smudged lights.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">From nowhere, a truck pulls out in front of them, and the cabdriver swears, by the beard of the prophet.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Salim stares at the name on the dashboard, but he cannot make it out from here. "How long have you been driving a cab, my friend?" he asks the man, in his own language.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Ten years," says the driver, in the same tongue. "Where are you from?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Muscat," says Salim. "In Oman."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"From Oman. I have been in Oman. It was a long time ago. Have you heard of the city of Ubar?" asks the taxi driver.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Indeed I have," says Salim. "The Lost City of Towers. They found it in the desert five, ten years ago, I do not remember exactly. Were you with the expedition that excavated it?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Something like that. It was a good city," says the taxi driver. "On most nights there would be three, maybe four thousand people camped there: every traveler would rest at Ubar, and the music would play, and the wine would flow like water and the water would flow as well, which was why the city existed."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That is what I have heard," says Salim. "And it perished, what, a thousand years ago? Two thousand?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The taxi driver says nothing. They are stopped at a red traffic light. The light turns green, but the driver does not move, despite the immediate discordant blare of horns behind them. Hesitantly, Salim reaches through the hole in the Plexiglas and he touches the driver on the shoulder. The man's head jerks up, with a start, and he puts his foot down on the gas, lurching them across the intersection.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Fuckshitfuckfuck," he says, in English.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You must be very tired, my friend," says Salim.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I have been driving this Allah-forgotten taxi for thirty hours," says the driver. "It is too much. Before that, I sleep for five hours, and I drove fourteen hours before that. We are shorthanded, before Christmas."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I hope you have made a lot of money," says Salim.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The driver sighs. "Not much. This morning I drove a man from Fifty-first Street to Newark Airport. When we got there, he ran off into the airport, and I could not find him again. A fifty-dollar fare gone, and I had to pay the tolls on the way back myself."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Salim nods. "I had to spend today waiting to see a man who will not see me. My brother-in-law hates me. I have been in America for a week, and it has done nothing but eat my money. I sell nothing."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What do you sell?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Shit," says Salim. "Worthless gewgaws and baubles and tourist trinkets. Horrible, cheap, foolish, ugly shit."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The taxi driver wrenches the wheel to the right, swings around something, drives on. Salim wonders how he can see to drive, between the rain, the night, and the thick sunglasses.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You try to sell shit?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes," says Salim, thrilled and horrified that he has spoken the truth about his brother-in-law's samples.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And they will not buy it?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Strange. You look at the stores here, that is all they sell."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Salim smiles nervously.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A truck is blocking the street in front of them: a red-faced cop standing in front of it waves and shouts and points them down the nearest street.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"We will go over to Eighth Avenue, come uptown that way," says the taxi driver. They turn onto the street, where the traffic has stopped completely. There is a cacophony of horns, but the cars do not move.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The driver sways in his seat. His chin begins to descend to his chest, one, two, three times. Then he begins, gently, to snore. Salim reaches out to wake the man, hoping that he is doing the right thing. As he shakes his shoulder, the driver moves, and Salim's hand brushes the man's face, knocking the sunglasses from his face into his lap.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The taxi driver opens his eyes, reaches for and replaces the black plastic sunglasses, but it is too late. Salim has seen his eyes.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The car crawls forward in the rain. The numbers on the meter increase.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Are you going to kill me?" asks Salim.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The taxi driver's lips are pressed together. Salim watches his face in the driver's mirror.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No," says the driver, very quietly.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The car stops again. The rain patters on the roof.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Salim begins to speak. "My grandmother swore that she had seen an ifrit, or perhaps a marid, late one evening, on the edge of the desert. We told her that it was just a sandstorm, a little wind, but she said no, she saw its face, and its eyes, like yours, were burning flames."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The driver smiles, but his eyes are hidden behind the black plastic glasses, and Salim cannot tell whether there is any humor in that smile or not. "The grandmothers came here too," he says.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Are there many jinn in New York?" asks Salim.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No. Not many of us."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"There are the angels, and there are men, who Allah made from mud, and then there are the people of the fire, the jinn," says Salim.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"People know nothing about my people here," says the driver. "They think we grant wishes. If I could grant wishes do you think I would be driving a cab?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I do not understand."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The taxi driver seems gloomy. Salim stares at his face in the mirror as he speaks, watching the ifrit's dark lips.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"They believe that we grant wishes. Why do they believe that? I sleep in one stinking room in Brooklyn. I drive this taxi for any stinking freak who has the money to ride in it, and for some who don't. I drive them where they need to go, and sometimes they tip me. Sometimes they pay me." His lower lip began to tremble. The ifrit seemed on edge. "One of them shat on the backseat once. I had to clean it before I could take the cab back. How could he do that? I had to clean the wet shit from the seat. Is that right?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Salim puts out a hand, pats the ifrit's shoulder. He can feel solid flesh through the wool of the sweater. The ifrit raises his hand from the wheel, rests it on Salim's hand for a moment.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Salim thinks of the desert then: red sands blow a dust storm through his thoughts, and the scarlet silks of the tents that surrounded the lost city of Ubar flap and billow through his mind.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They drive up Eighth Avenue.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"The old believe. They do not piss into holes, because the Prophet told them that jinn live in holes. They know that the angels throw flaming stars at us when we try to listen to their conversations. But even for the old, when they come to this country we are very, very far away. Back there, I did not have to drive a cab."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I am sorry," says Salim.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It is a bad time," says the driver. "A storm is coming. It scares me. I would do anything to get away."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The two of them say nothing more on their way back to the hotel.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">When Salim gets out of the cab he gives the ifrit a twenty-dollar bill, tells him to keep the change. Then, with a sudden burst of courage, he tells him his room number. The taxi driver says nothing in reply. A young woman clambers into the back of the cab, and it pulls out into the cold and the rain.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Six o'clock in the evening. Salim has not yet written the fax to his brother-in-law. He goes out into the rain, buys himself this night's kabob and french fries. It has only been a week, but he feels that he is becoming heavier, rounder, softening in this country of New York.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">When he comes back to the hotel he is surprised to see the taxi driver standing in the lobby, hands deep in his pockets. He is staring at a display of black-and-white postcards. When he sees Salim he smiles, self-consciously. "I called your room," he says, "but there was no answer. So I thought I would wait."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Salim smiles also, and touches the man's arm. "I am here," he says.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Together they enter the dim, green-lit elevator, ascend to the fifth floor holding hands. The ifrit asks if he may use Salim's bathroom. "I feel very dirty," he says. Salim nods. He sits on the bed, which fills most of the small white room, and listens to the sound of the shower running. Salim takes off his shoes, his socks, and then the rest of his clothes.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The taxi driver comes out of the shower, wet, with a towel wrapped about his midsection. He is not wearing his sunglasses, and in the dim room his eyes burn with scarlet flames.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Salim blinks back tears. "I wish you could see what I see," he says.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I do not grant wishes," whispers the ifrit, dropping his towel and pushing Salim gently, but irresistibly, down onto the bed.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It is an hour or more before the ifrit comes, thrusting and grinding into Salim's mouth. Salim has already come twice in this time. The jinn's semen tastes strange, fiery, and it burns Salim's throat.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Salim goes to the bathroom, washes out his mouth. When he returns to the bedroom the taxi driver is already asleep in the white bed, snoring peacefully. Salim climbs into the bed beside him, cuddles close to the ifrit, imagining the desert on his skin.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">As he starts to fall asleep he realizes that he still has not written his fax to Fuad, and he feels guilty. Deep inside he feels empty and alone: he reaches out, rests his hand on the ifrit's tumescent cock and, comforted, he sleeps. They wake in the small hours, moving against each other, and they make love again. At one point Salim realizes that he is crying, and the ifrit is kissing away his tears with burning lips. "What is your name?" Salim asks the taxi driver.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"There is a name on my driving permit, but it is not mine," the ifrit says.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Afterward, Salim could not remember where the sex had stopped and the dreams began.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">When Salim wakes, the cold sun creeping into the white room, he is alone.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Also, he discovers, his sample case is gone, all the bottles and rings and souvenir copper flashlights, all gone, along with his suitcase, his wallet, his passport, and his air tickets back to Oman.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He finds a pair of jeans, the T-shirt, and the dust-colored woolen sweater discarded on the floor. Beneath them he finds a driver's license in the name of Ibrahim bin Irem, a taxi permit in the same name, and a ring of keys with an address written on a piece of paper attached to them in English. The photographs on the license and the permit do not look much like Salim, but then, they did not look much like the ifrit.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The telephone rings: it is the front desk calling to point out that Salim has already checked out and his guest needs to leave soon so that they can service the room, to get it ready for another occupant.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I do not grant wishes," says Salim, tasting the way the words shape themselves in his mouth.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He feels strangely light-headed as he dresses.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">New York is very simple: the avenues run north to south, the streets run west to east. How hard can it be? he asks himself.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He tosses the car keys into the air and catches them. Then he puts on the black plastic sunglasses he found in the pockets, and leaves the hotel room to go and look for his cab.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_18"></div></div></body>
