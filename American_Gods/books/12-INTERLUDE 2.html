Is that you?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Who else? Leon said that Auntie Sammy called when I was in the shower."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"We had a good talk. He's such a sweet kid."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yeah. I think I'll keep him."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A moment of discomfort for both of them, barely a crackle of a whisper over the telephone lines. Then, "Sammy, how's school?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"They're giving us a week off. Problem with the furnaces. How are things in your neck of the North Woods?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Well, I've got a new next-door neighbor. He does coin tricks. The Lakeside News letter column currently features a blistering debate on the potential rezoning of the town land down by the old cemetery on the southeast shore of the lake and yours truly has to write a strident editorial summarizing the paper's position on this without offending anybody or in fact giving anyone any idea what our position is."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Sounds like fun."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It's not. Alison McGovern vanished last week-Jilly and Stan McGovern's oldest. Nice kid. She baby-sat for Leon a few times."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A mouth opens to say something, and it closes again, leaving whatever it was to say unsaid, and instead it says, "That's awful."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"So…" and there's nothing to follow that with that isn't going to hurt, so she says, "Is he cute?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Who?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"The neighbor."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"His name's Ainsel. Mike Ainsel. He's okay. Too young for me. Big guy, looks…what's the word. Begins with an M."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Mean? Moody? Magnificent? Married?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A short laugh, then, "Yes, I guess he does look married. I mean, if there's a look that married men have, he kind of has it. But the word I was thinking of was Melancholy. He looks Melancholy."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And Mysterious?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Not particularly. When he moved in he seemed kinda helpless-he didn't even know to heat-seal the windows. These days he still looks like he doesn't know what he's doing here. When he's here-he's here, then he's gone again. I've seen him out walking from time to time."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Maybe he's a bank robber."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Uh-huh. Just what I was thinking."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You were not. That was my idea. Listen, Mags, how are you? Are you okay?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yeah."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Really?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A long pause then. "I'm coming up to see you."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Sammy, no."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It'll be after the weekend, before the furnaces are working and school starts again. It'll be fun. You can make up a bed on the couch for me. And invite the mysterious neighbor over for dinner one night."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Sam, you're matchmaking."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Who's matchmaking? After Claudine-the-bitch-from-hell, maybe I'm ready to go back to boys for a while. I met a nice strange boy when I hitchhiked down to El Paso for Christmas."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Oh. Look, Sam, you've got to stop hitchhiking."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"How do you think I'm going to get to Lakeside?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Alison McGovern was hitchhiking. Even in a town like this, it's not safe. I'll wire you the money. You can take the bus."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'll be fine."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Sammy."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Okay, Mags. Wire me the money if it'll let you sleep easier."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You know it will."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Okay, bossy big sister. Give Leon a bug and tell him Auntie Sammy's coming up and he's not to hide his toys in her bed this time."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'll tell him. I don't promise it'll do any good."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"So when should I expect you?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Tomorrow night. You don't have to meet me at the bus station-I'll ask Hinzelmann to run me over in Tessie."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Too late. Tessie's in mothballs for the winter. But Hinzelmann will give you a ride anyway. He likes you. You listen to his stories."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Maybe you should get Hinzelmann to write your editorial for you. Let's see. 'On the Rezoning of the Land by the Old Cemetery. It so happens that in the winter of ought-three my grampaw shot a stag down by the old cemetery by the lake. He was out of bullets, so he used a cherry-stone from the lunch my grandmama had packed for him. Creased the skull of the stag and it shot off like a bat out of heck. Two years later he was down that way and he sees this mighty buck with a spreading cherry tree growing between its antlers. Well, he shot it, and grandmama made cherry pies enough that they were still eating them come the next fourth of July…'" And they both laughed, then.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_28"></div></div></body>
