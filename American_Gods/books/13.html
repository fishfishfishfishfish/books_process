Shadow answered the door.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Marguerite Olsen was there. She did hot come in, just stood in the sunlight, looking serious. "Mister Ainsel…?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Mike, please," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Mike, yes. Would you like to come over for dinner tonight? About six, eh? It won't be anything exciting, just spaghetti and meatballs."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I like spaghetti and meatballs."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Obviously, if you have any other plans…"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I have no other plans."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Six o'clock."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Should I bring flowers?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"If you must. But this is a social gesture. Not a romantic one."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He showered. He went for a short walk, down to the bridge and back. The sun was up, a tarnished quarter in the sky, and he was sweating in his coat by the time he got home. He drove the 4-Runner down to Dave's Finest Food and bought a bottle of wine. It was a twenty-dollar bottle, which seemed to Shadow like some kind of guarantee of quality. He didn't know wines, so he bought a Californian cabernet, because Shadow had once seen a bumper-sticker, back when he was younger and people still had bumper stickers on their cars, which said LIFE is A CABERNET and it had made him laugh.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He bought a plant in a pot as a gift. Green leaves, no flowers. Nothing remotely romantic about that.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He bought a carton of milk, which he would never drink, and a selection of fruit, which he would never eat.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Then he drove over to Mabel's and bought a single lunchtime pasty. Mabel's face lit up when she saw him. "Did Hinzelmann catch up with you?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I didn't know he was looking for me."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yup. Wants to take you ice fishing. And Chad Mulligan wanted to know if I'd seen you around. His cousin's here from out of state. His second cousin, what we used to call kissing cousins. Such a sweetheart. You'll love her," and she dropped the pasty into a brown paper bag, twisted the top over to keep the pasty warm.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow drove the long way home, eating one-handed, the pastry crumbs tumbling onto his jeans and onto the floor of the 4-Runner. He passed the library on the south shore of the lake. It was a black-and-white town in the ice and the snow. Spring seemed unimaginably far away: the klunker would always sit on the ice, with the ice-fishing shelters and the pickup trucks and the snowmobile tracks.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He reached his apartment, parked, walked up the drive, up the wooden steps to his apartment. The goldfinches and nuthatches on the birdfeeder hardly gave him a glance. He went inside. He watered the plant, wondered whether or not to put the wine into the refrigerator.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was a lot of time to kill until six. Shadow wished he could comfortably watch television once more. He wanted to be entertained, not to have to think, just to sit and let the sounds and the light wash over him. Do you want to see Lucy's tits? something with a Lucy voice whispered in his memory, and he shook his head, although there was no one there to see him.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He was nervous, he realized. This would be his first real social interaction with other people-normal people, not people in jail, not gods or culture heroes or dreams-since he was first arrested, over three years ago. He would have to make conversation, as Mike Ainsel.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He checked his watch. It was two-thirty. Marguerite Olsen had told him to be there at six. Did she mean six exactly? Should he be there a little early? A little late? He decided, eventually, to walk next door at five past six.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow's telephone rang.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yeah?" he said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That's no way to answer the phone," growled Wednesday.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"When I get my telephone connected I'll answer it politely," said Shadow. "Can I help you?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I don't know," said Wednesday. There was a pause. Then he said, "Organizing gods is like herding cats into straight lines. They don't take naturally to it." There was a deadness, and an exhaustion, in Wednesday's voice that Shadow had never heard before.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What's wrong?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It's hard. It's too fucking hard. I don't know if this is going to work. We might as well cut our throats. Just cut our own throats."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You mustn't talk like that."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yeah. Right."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Well, if you do cut your throat," said Shadow, trying to jolly Wednesday out of his darkness, "maybe it wouldn't even hurt."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It would hurt. Even for my kind, pain still hurts. If you move and act in the material world, then the material world acts on you. Pain hurts, just as greed intoxicates and lust burns. We may not die easy and we sure as hell don't die well, but we can die. If we're still loved and remembered, something else a whole lot like us comes along and takes our place and the whole damn thing starts all over again. And if we're forgotten, we're done."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow did not know what to say. He said, "So where are you calling from?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"None of your goddamn business."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Are you drunk?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Not yet. I just keep thinking about Thor. You never knew him. Big guy, like you. Good-hearted. Not bright, but he'd give you the goddamned shirt off his back if you asked him. And he killed himself. He put a gun in his mouth and blew his head off in Philadelphia in 1932. What kind of a way is that for a god to die?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'm sorry."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You don't give two fucking cents, son. He was a whole lot like you. Big and dumb." Wednesday stopped talking. He coughed.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What's wrong?" said Shadow, for the second time.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"They got in touch."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Who did?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"The opposition."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"They want to discuss a truce. Peace talks. Live and let fucking live."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"So what happens now?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Now I go and drink bad coffee with the modern assholes in a Kansas City Masonic Hall."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Okay. You going to pick me up, or shall I meet you somewhere?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You stay there and you keep your head down. Don't get into any trouble. You hear me?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"But-"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was a click, and the line went dead and stayed dead. There was no dial tone, but then, there never had been.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Nothing but time to kill. The conversation with Wednesday had left Shadow with a sense of disquiet. He got up, intending to go for a walk, but already the light was fading, and he sat back down again.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow picked up the Minutes of the Lakeside City Council 1872-1884 and turned the pages, his eyes scanning the tiny print, not actually reading it, occasionally stopping to scan something that caught his eye.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">In July 1874, Shadow learned, the city council was concerned about the number of itinerant foreign loggers arriving in the town. An opera house was to be built on the corner of Third Street and Broadway. It was to be expected that the nuisances attendant to the damming of the Mill-Creek would abate once the mill-pond had become a lake. The council authorized the payment of seventy dollars to Mr. Samuel Samuels, and of eighty-five dollars to Mr. Heikki Salminen, in compensation for their land and for the expenses incurred in moving their domiciles out of the area to be flooded.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It had never occurred to Shadow before that the lake was manmade. Why call a town Lakeside, when the lake had begun as a dammed mill-pond? He read on, to discover that a Mr. Hinzelmann, originally of Hildemuhlen in Bavaria, was in charge of the lake-building project, and that the city council had granted him the sum of $370 toward the project, any shortfall to be made up by public subscription. Shadow tore off a strip of a paper towel and placed it into the book as a bookmark. He could imagine Hinzelmann's pleasure in seeing the reference to his grandfather. He wondered if the old man knew that his family had been instrumental in building the lake. Shadow flipped forward through the book, scanning for more references to the lake-building project.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They had dedicated the lake in a ceremony in the spring of 1876, as a precursor to the town's centennial celebrations. A vote of thanks to Mr. Hinzelmann was taken by the council.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow checked his watch. It was five-thirty. He went into the bathroom, shaved, combed his hair. He changed his clothes. Somehow the final fifteen minutes passed. He got the wine and the plant, arid he walked next door.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The door opened as he knocked. Marguerite Olsen looked almost as nervous as he felt. She took the wine bottle and the potted plant, and said thank you. The television was on, The Wizard of Oz on video. It was still in sepia, and Dorothy was still in Kansas, sitting with her eyes closed in Professor Marvel's wagon as the old fraud pretended to read her mind, and the twister-wind that would tear her away from her life was approaching. Leon sat in front of the screen, playing with a toy fire truck. When he saw Shadow an expression of delight touched his face; he stood up and ran, tripping over his feet in his excitement, into a back bedroom, from which he emerged a moment later triumphantly waving a quarter.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Watch, Mike Ainsel!" he shouted. Then closed both his hands and he pretended to take the coin into his right hand, which he opened wide. "I made it disappear, Mike Ainsel!"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You did," agreed Shadow. "After we've eaten, if it's okay with your mom, I'll show you how to do it even smoother than that."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Do it now if you want," said Marguerite. "We're still waiting for Samantha. I sent her out for sour cream. I don't know what's taking her so long."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">And, as if that was her cue, footsteps sounded on the wooden deck, and somebody shouldered open the front door. Shadow did not recognize her at first, then she said, "I didn't know if you wanted the kind with calories or the kind that tastes like wallpaper paste so I went for the kind with calories," and he knew her then: the girl from the road to Cairo.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That's fine," said Marguerite. "Sam, this is my neighbor, Mike Ainsel. Mike, this is Samantha Black Crow, my sister."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">I don't know you, thought Shadow desperately. You've never met me before. We're total strangers. He tried to remember how he had thought snow, how easy and light that had been: this was desperate. He put out his hand and said, "Pleased to meetcha."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She blinked, looked up at his face. A moment of puzzlement, then recognition entered her eyes and curved the corners of her mouth into a grin. "Hello," she said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'll see how the food is doing," said Marguerite, in the taut voice of someone who burns things in kitchens if they leave them alone and unwatched even for a moment.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Sam took off her puffy coat and her hat. "So you're the melancholy but mysterious neighbor," she said. "Who'da thunk it?" She kept her voice down.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And you," he said, "are girl Sam. Can we talk about this later?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"If you promise to tell me what's going on."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Deal."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Leon tugged at the leg of Shadow's pants. "Will you show me now?" he asked, and held out his quarter.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Okay," said Shadow. "But if I show you, you have to remember that a master magician never tells anyone how it's done."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I promise," said Leon, gravely. Shadow took the coin in his left hand, then moved Leon's right hand, showing him how to appear to take the coin in his right hand while actually leaving it in Shadow's left hand. Then he made Leon repeat the movements on his own.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">After several attempts the boy mastered the move. "Now you know half of it," said Shadow. "The other half is this: put your attention on the place where the coin ought to be. Look at the place it's meant to be. If you act like it's in your right hand, no one will even look at your left hand, no matter how clumsy you are."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Sam watched all this with her head tipped slightly on one side, saying nothing.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Dinner!" called Marguerite, pushing her way in from the kitchen with a steaming bowl of spaghetti in her hands. "Leon, go wash your hands."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was crusty garlic bread, thick red sauce, good spicy meatballs. Shadow complimented Marguerite on it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Old family recipe," she told him, "from the Corsican side of the family."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I thought you were Native American."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Dad's Cherokee," said Sam. "Mag's mom's father came from Corsica." Sam was the only person in the room who was actually drinking the cabernet. "Dad left her when Mags was ten and he moved across town. Six months after that, I was born. Mom and Dad got married when the divorce came through. When I was ten he went away. I think he has a ten-year attention span."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Well, he's been out in Oklahoma for ten years," said Marguerite.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Now, my mom's family were European Jewish," continued Sam, "from one of those places that used to be communist and now are just chaos. I think she liked the idea of being married to a Cherokee. Fry bread and chopped liver." She took another sip of the red wine.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Sam's mom's a wild woman," said Marguerite, semi-approvingly.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You know where she is now?" asked Sam. Shadow shook his head. "She's in Australia. She met a guy on the Internet who lived in Hobart. When they met in the flesh she decided he was actually kind of icky. But she really liked Tasmania. So she's living down there, with a woman's group, teaching them to batik cloth and things like that. Isn't that cool? At her age?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow agreed that it was, and helped himself to more meatballs. Sam told them how all the aboriginal natives of Tasmania had been wiped out by the British, and about the human chain they made across the island to catch them which trapped only an old man and a sick boy. She told him how the thylacines-the Tasmanian tigers-had been killed by farmers, scared for their sheep, how the politicians in the 1930s noticed that the thylacines should be protected only after the last of them was dead. She finished her second glass of wine, poured her third.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"So, Mike," said Sam, suddenly, her cheeks reddening, "tell us about your family. What are the Ainsels like?" She was smiling, and there was mischief in that smile.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"We're real dull," said Shadow. "None of us ever got as far as Tasmania. So you're at school in Madison. What's that like?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You know," she said. "I'm studying art history, women's studies, and casting my own bronzes."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"When I grow up," said Leon, "I'm going to do magic. Poof. Will you teach me, Mike Ainsel?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Sure," said Shadow. "If your mom doesn't mind."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Sam said, "After we've eaten, while you're putting Leon to bed, Mags, I think I'm going to get Mike to take me to the Buck Stops Here for an hour or so."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Marguerite did not shrug. Her head moved, her eyebrow raised slightly.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I think he's interesting," said Sam. "And we have lots to talk about."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Marguerite looked at Shadow, who busied himself in dabbing an imaginary blob of red sauce from his chin with a paper napkin. "Well, you're grownups," she said, in a tone of voice that implied that they weren't, and that even if they were they shouldn't be.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">After dinner Shadow helped Sam with the washing up-he dried-and then he did a trick for Leon, counting pennies into Leon's palm: each time Leon opened his hand and counted them there was one less coin than he had counted in. And as for the final penny-"Are you squeezing it? Tightly?"-when Leon opened his hand he found it had transformed into a dime. Leon's plaintive cries of "How'd you do that? Momma, how'd he do that?" followed him out into the hall.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Sam handed him his coat. "Come on," she said. Her cheeks were flushed from the wine.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Outside it was cold.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow stopped in his apartment, tossed the Minutes of the Lakeside City Council into a plastic grocery bag, and brought it along. Hinzelmann might be down at the Buck, and he wanted to show him the mention of his grandfather.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They walked down the drive side by side.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He opened the garage door, and she started to laugh. "Omigod," she said, when she saw the 4-Runner. "Paul Gunther's car. You bought Paul Gunther's car. Omigod."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow opened the door for her. Then he went around and got in. "You know the car?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"When I came up here two or three years ago to stay with Mags. It was me that persuaded him to paint it purple."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Oh," said Shadow. "It's good to have someone to blame."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He drove the car out onto the street. Got out and closed the garage door. Got back into the car. Sam was looking at him oddly as he got in, as if the confidence had begun to leak out of her. He put on his seat belt, and she said, "Okay. This is a stupid thing to do, isn't it? Getting into a car with a psycho killer."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I got you home safe last time," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You killed two men," she said. "You're wanted by the feds. And now I find out you're living under an assumed name next door to my sister. Unless Mike Ainsel is your real name?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No," said Shadow, and he sighed. "It's not." He hated saying it. It was as if he was letting go of something important, abandoning Mike Ainsel by denying him; as if he were taking his leave of a friend.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Did you kill those men?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"They came to my house, and said we'd been seen together. And this guy showed me photographs of you. What was his name-Mister Hat? No. Mister Town. It was like The Fugitive. But I said I hadn't seen you."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Thank you."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"So," she said. "Tell me what's going on. I'll keep your secrets if you keep mine."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I don't know any of yours," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Well, you know that it was my idea to paint this thing purple, thus forcing Paul Gunther to become such an object of scorn and derision for several counties around that he was forced to leave town entirely. We were kind of stoned," she admitted.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I doubt that bit of it's much of a secret," said Shadow. "Everyone in Lakeside must have known. It's a stoner sort of purple."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">And then she said, very quiet, very fast, "If you're going to kill me please don't hurt me. I shouldn't have come here with you. I am so fucking fucking dumb. I can identify you. Jesus."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow sighed. "I've never killed anybody. Really. Now I'm going to take you to the Buck," he said. "We'll have a drink. Or if you give the word, I'll turn this car around and take you home. Either way, I'll just have to hope you aren't going to call the cops."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was silence as they crossed the bridge.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Who did kill those men?" she asked.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You wouldn't believe me if I told you."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I would." She sounded angry now. He wondered if bringing the wine to the dinner had been a wise idea. Life was certainly not a cabernet right now.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It's not easy to believe."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I," she told him, "can believe anything. You have no idea what I can believe."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Really?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I can believe things that are true and I can believe things that aren't true and I can believe things where nobody knows if they're true or not. I can believe in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and Marilyn Monroe and the Beatles and Elvis and Mister Ed. Listen-I believe that people are perfectible, that knowledge is infinite, that the world is run by secret banking cartels and is visited by aliens on a regular basis, nice ones that look like wrinkledy lemurs and bad ones who mutilate cattle and want our water and our women. I believe that the future sucks and I believe that the future rocks and I believe that one day White Buffalo Woman is going to come back and kick everyone's ass. I believe that all men are just overgrown boys with deep problems communicating and that the decline in good sex in America is coincident with the decline in drive-in movie theaters from state to state. I believe that all politicians are unprincipled crooks and I still believe that they are better than the alternative. I believe that California is going to sink into the sea when the big one comes, while Florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste. I believe that antibacterial soap is destroying our resistance to dirt and disease so that one day we'll all be wiped out by the common cold like the Martians in War of the Worlds. I believe that the greatest poets of the last century were Edith Sitwell and Don Marquis, that jade is dried dragon sperm, and that thousands of years ago in a former life I was a one-armed Siberian shaman. I believe that mankind's destiny lies in the stars. I believe that candy really did taste better when I was a kid, that it's aerodynamically impossible for a bumblebee to fly, that light is a wave and a particle, that there's a cat in a box somewhere who's alive and dead at the same time (although if they don't ever open the box to feed it it'll eventually just be two different kinds of dead), and that there are stars in the universe billions of years older than the universe itself. I believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversees everything I do. I believe in an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesn't even know that I'm alive. I believe in an empty and godless universe of causal chaos, background noise, and sheer blind luck. I believe that anyone who says that sex is overrated just hasn't done it properly. I believe that anyone who claims to know what's going on will lie about the little things too. I believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies. I believe in a woman's right to choose, a baby's right to live, that while all human life is sacred there's nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly, and that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system. I believe that life is a game, that life is a cruel joke, and that life is what happens when you're alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it." She stopped, out of breath.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow almost took his hands off the wheel to applaud. Instead he said, "Okay. So if I tell you what I've learned you won't think that I'm a nut."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Maybe," she said. "Try me."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Would you believe that all the gods that people have ever imagined are still with us today?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"…Maybe."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And that there are new gods out there, gods of computers and telephones and whatever, and that they all seem to think there isn't room for them both in the world. And that some kind of war is kind of likely."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And these gods killed those two men?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No, my wife killed those two men."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I thought you said your wife was dead."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"She is."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"She killed them before she died, then?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"After. Don't ask."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She reached up a hand and flicked her hair from her forehead.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They pulled up on Main Street, outside the Buck Stops Here. The sign over the window showed a surprised-looking stag standing on its hind legs holding a glass of beer. Shadow grabbed the bag with the book in it and got out.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Why would they have a war?" asked Sam. "It seems kind of redundant. What is there to win?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I don't know," admitted Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It's easier to believe in aliens than in gods," said Sam. "Maybe Mister Town and Mister Whatever were Men in Black, only the alien kind."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They were standing on the sidewalk outside the Buck Stops Here and Sam stopped. She looked up at Shadow, and her breath hung on the night air like a faint cloud. She said, "Just tell me you're one of the good guys."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I can't," said Shadow. "I wish I could. But I'm doing my best."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She looked up at him, and bit her lower lip. Then she nodded. "Good enough," she said. "I won't turn you in. You can buy me a beer."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow pushed the door open for her, and they were hit by a blast of heat and music. They went inside.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Sam waved at some friends. Shadow nodded to a handful of people whose faces-although not their names-he remembered from the day he had spent searching for Alison McGovern, or who he had met in Mabel's in the morning. Chad Mulligan was standing at the bar, with his arm around the shoulders of a small red-haired woman-the kissing cousin, Shadow figured. He wondered what she looked like, but she had her back to him. Chad's hand raised in a mock salute when he saw Shadow. Shadow grinned, and waved back at him. Shadow looked around for Hinzelmann, but the old man did not seem to be there this evening. He spied a free table at the back and started walking toward it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Then somebody began to scream.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It was a bad scream, a full-throated, seen-a-ghost hysterical scream, which silenced all conversation. Shadow looked around, certain somebody was being murdered, and then he realized that all the faces in the bar were turning toward him. Even the black cat, who slept in the window during the day, was standing up on top of the jukebox with its tail high and its back arched and was staring at Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Time slowed.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Get him!" shouted a woman's voice, parked on the verge of hysteria. "Oh for God's sake, somebody stop him! Don't let him get away! Please!" It was a voice he knew.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Nobody moved. They stared at Shadow. He stared back at them.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Chad Mulligan stepped forward, walking through the people. The small woman walked behind him warily, her eyes wide, as if she was preparing to start screaming once more. Shadow knew her. Of course he knew her.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Chad was still holding his beer, which he put down on a nearby table. He said, "Mike."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow said, "Chad."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Audrey Burton took hold of Chad's sleeve. Her face was white, and there were tears in her eyes. "Shadow," she said. "You bastard. You murderous evil bastard."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Are you sure that you know this man, hon?" said Chad. He looked uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Audrey Burton looked at him incredulously. "Are you crazy? He worked for Robbie for years. His slutty wife was my best friend. He's wanted for murder. I had to answer questions. He's an escaped convict." She was way over the top, her voice trembling with suppressed hysteria, sobbing out her words like a soap actress going for a daytime Emmy. Kissing cousins, thought Shadow, unimpressed.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Nobody in the bar said a word. Chad Mulligan looked up at Shadow. "It's probably a mistake. I'm sure we can sort this all out," he said. Then he said, to the bar, "It's all fine. Nothing to worry about. We can sort this out. Everything's fine." Then, to Shadow, "Let's step outside, Mike." Quiet competence. Shadow was impressed.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Sure," said Shadow. He felt a hand touch his hand, and he turned to see Sam staring at him. He smiled down at her as reassuringly as he could.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Sam looked at Shadow, then she looked around the bar at the faces staring at them. She said to Audrey Burton, "I don't know who you are. But. You. Are such. A cunt." Then she went up on tiptoes and pulled Shadow down to her, and kissed him hard on the lips, pushing her mouth against his for what felt to Shadow like several minutes, and might have been as long as five seconds in real, clock-ticking time.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It was a strange kiss, Shadow thought, as her lips pressed against his: it wasn't intended for him. It was for the other people in the bar, to let them know that she had picked sides. It was a flag-waving kiss. Even as she kissed him, he became certain that she didn't even like him-well, not like that.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Still, there was a tale he had read once, long ago, as a small boy: the story of a traveler who had slipped down a cliff, with man-eating tigers above him and a lethal fall below him, who managed to stop his fall halfway down the side of the cliff, holding on for dear life. There was a clump of strawberries beside him, and certain death above him and below. What should he do? went the question.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">And the reply was, Eat the strawberries.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The story had never made any sense to him as a boy. It did now. So he closed his eyes, threw himself into the kiss and experienced nothing but Sam's lips and the softness of her skin against his, sweet as a wild strawberry.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"C'mon Mike," said Chad Mulligan, firmly. "Please. Let's take it outside."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Sam pulled back. She licked her lips, and smiled, a smile that nearly reached her eyes. "Not bad," she said. "You kiss good for a boy. Okay, go play outside." Then she turned to Audrey Burton. "But you," she said, "are still a cunt."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow tossed Sam his car keys. She caught them, one-handed. He walked through the bar and stepped outside, followed by Chad Mulligan. A gentle snow had begun to fall, the flakes spinning down into the light of the neon bar sign. "You want to talk about this?" asked Chad.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Audrey had followed them out onto the sidewalk. She looked as if she were ready to start screaming again. She said, "He killed two men, Chad. The FBI came to my door. He's a psycho. I'll come down to the station with you, if you want."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You've caused enough trouble, ma'am," said Shadow. He sounded tired, even to himself. "Please go away."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Chad? Did you hear that? He threatened me!" said Audrey.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Get back inside, Audrey," said Chad Mulligan. She looked as if she were about to argue, then she pressed her lips together so hard they went white, and went back into the bar.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Would you like to comment on anything she said?" asked Chad Mulligan.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I've never killed anyone," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Chad nodded. "I believe you," he said. "I'm sure we can deal with these allegations easily enough. You won't give me any trouble, will you, Mike?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No trouble," said Shadow. "This is all a mistake."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Exactly," said Chad. "So I figure we ought to head down to my office and sort it all out there?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Am I under arrest?" asked Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Nope," said Chad. "Not unless you want to be. I figure, you come with me out of a sense of civic duty, and we'll straighten all this out."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Chad patted Shadow down, found no weapons. They got into Mulligan's car. Again Shadow sat in the back, looking out through the metal cage. He thought, SOS. Mayday. Help. He tried to push Mulligan with his mind, as he'd once pushed a cop in Chicago-This is your old friend Mike Ainsel. You saved his life. Don't you know how silly this is? Why don't you just drop the whole thing?</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I figure it was good to get you out of there," said Chad. "All you needed was some loudmouth deciding that you were Alison McGovern's killer and we'd've had a lynch mob on our hands."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Point."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They were silent for the rest of the drive to the Lakeside police building, which, Chad said as they pulled up outside it, actually belonged to the county sheriff's department. The local police made do with a few rooms in there. Pretty soon the county would build something modern. For now they had to make do with what they had.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They walked inside.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Should I call a lawyer?" asked Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You aren't accused of anything," said Mulligan. "Up to you." They pushed through some swing doors. "Take a seat over there."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow took a seat on the wooden chair with cigarette burns on the side. He felt stupid and numb. There was a small poster on the notice board, beside a large NO SMOKING sign: ENDANGERED MISSING it said. The photograph was Alison McGovern's.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was a wooden table with old copies of Sports Illustrated and Newsweek on it. The light was bad. The paint on the wall was yellow, but it might once have been white.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">After ten minutes Chad brought him a watery cup of vending machine hot chocolate. "What's in the bag?" he asked. And it was only then that Shadow realized he was still holding the plastic bag containing the Minutes of the Lakeside City Council.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Old book," said Shadow. "Your grandfather's picture's in here. Or great-grandfather maybe."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yeah?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow flipped through the book until he found the portrait of the town council, and he pointed to the man called Mulligan. Chad chuckled. "If that don't beat all," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Minutes passed, and hours, in that room. Shadow read two of the Sports Illustrateds and he started in on the Newsweek. From time to time Chad would come through, once checking to see if Shadow needed to use the rest room, once to offer him a ham roll and a small packet of potato chips.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Thanks," said Shadow, taking them. "Am I under arrest yet?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Chad sucked the air between his teeth. "Well," he said, "not yet. It doesn't look like you came by the name Mike Ainsel legally. On the other hand, you can call yourself whatever you want in this state, if it's not for fraudulent purposes. You just hang loose."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Can I make a phone call?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Is it a local call?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Long distance."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It'll save money if I put it on my calling card, otherwise you'll just be feeding ten bucks worth of quarters into that thing in the hall."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Sure, thought Shadow. And this way you'll know the number I dialed, and you'll probably be listening in on an extension.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That would be great," said Shadow. They wait into an empty office. The number Shadow gave Chad to dial for him was that of a funeral home in Cairo, Illinois. Chad dialed it, handed Shadow the receiver. "I'll leave you in here," he said, and went out.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The telephone rang several times, then it was picked up.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Jacquel and Ibis? Can I help you?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Hi. Mister Ibis, this is Mike Ainsel. I helped out there for a few days over Christmas."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A moment's hesitation, then, "Of course. Mike. How are you?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Not great, Mister Ibis. In a patch of trouble. About to be arrested. Hoping you'd seen my uncle about, or maybe you could get a message to him."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I can certainly ask around. Hold on, uh, Mike. There's someone here who wishes a word with you."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The phone was passed to somebody, and then a smoky female voice said "Hi, honey. I miss you."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He was certain he'd never heard that voice before. But he knew her. He was sure that he knew her…</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Let it go, the smoky voice whispered in his mind, in a dream. Let it all go.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Who's that girl you were kissing, hon? You trying to make me jealous?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"We're just friends," said Shadow. "I think she was trying to prove a point. How did you know she kissed me?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I got eyes wherever my folk walk," she said. "You take care now, hon…" There was a moment of silence, then Mr. Ibis came back on the line and said, "Mike?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"There's a problem getting hold of your uncle. He seems to be kind of tied up. But I'll try and get a message to your aunt Nancy. Best of luck." The line went dead.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow sat down, expecting Chad to return. He sat in the empty office, wishing he had something to distract him. Reluctantly, he picked up the Minutes once more, opened it to somewhere in the middle of the book, and began to read.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">An ordinance prohibiting expectoration on sidewalks and on the floors of public buildings, or throwing thereon tobacco in any form was introduced and passed, eight to four, in December of 1876.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Lemmi Hautala was twelve years old and had, "it was feared, wandered away in a fit of delirium" on December 13, 1876. "A search being immediately effected, but impeded by the snows, which are blinding." The council had voted unanimously to send the Hautala family their condolences.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The fire at Olsen's livery stables the following week was extinguished without any injury or loss of life, human or equine.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow scanned the closely printed columns. He found no further mention of Lemmi Hautala.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">And then, on something slightly more than a whim, Shadow flipped the pages forward to the winter of 1877. He found what he was looking for mentioned as an aside in the January minutes: Jessie Lovat, age not given, "a Negro child," had vanished on the night of December 28. It was believed that she might have been "abducted by traveling so-called pedlars." Condolences were not sent to the Lovat family.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow was scanning the minutes of winter 1878 when Chad Mulligan knocked and entered, looking shamefaced, like a child bringing home a bad report card.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Mister Ainsel," he said. "Mike. I'm truly sorry about this. Personally, I like you. But that don't change anything, you know?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow said he knew.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I got no choice in the matter," said Chad, "but to place you under arrest for violating your parole." Then Mulligan read Shadow his rights. He filled out some paperwork. He took Shadow's prints. He walked him down the hall to the county jail, on the other side of the building.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was a long counter and several doorways on one side of the room, two glassed-in holding cells and a doorway on the other. One of the cells was occupied-a man slept on a cement bed under a thin blanket. The other was empty.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was a sleepy-looking woman in a brown uniform behind the counter, watching Jay Leno on a small white portable television. She took the papers from Chad, and signed for Shadow. Chad hung around, filled in more papers. The woman came around the counter, patted Shadow down, took all his possessions-wallet, coins, front door key, book, watch-and put them on the counter, then gave him a plastic bag with orange clothes in it and told him to go into the open cell and change into them. He could keep his own underwear and socks. He went in and changed into the orange clothes and the shower footwear. It stank evilly in there. The orange top he pulled over his head had LUMBER COUNTY JAIL written on the back in large black letters.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The metal toilet in the cell had backed up, and was filled to the brim with a brown stew of liquid feces and sour, beerish urine.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow came back out, gave the woman his clothes, which she put into the plastic bag with the rest of his possessions. He had thumbed through the wallet before he handed it over. "You take care of this," he had said to the woman. "My whole life is in here." The woman took the wallet from him, and assured him that it would be safe with them. She asked Chad if that wasn't true, and Chad, looking up from the last of his paperwork, said Liz was telling the truth, they'd never lost a prisoner's possessions yet.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow had slipped the four hundred-dollar bills that he had palmed from the wallet into his socks, when he had changed, along with the silver Liberty dollar he had palmed as he had emptied his pockets.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Say," Shadow asked, when he came out. "Would it be okay if I finished reading the book?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Sorry, Mike. Rules are rules," said Chad.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Liz put Shadow's possessions in a bag in the back room. Chad said he'd leave Shadow in Officer Bute's capable hands. Liz looked tired and unimpressed. Chad left. The telephone rang, and Liz-Officer Bute-answered it. "Okay," she said. "Okay. No problem. Okay. No problem. Okay." She put down the phone and made a face.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Problem?" asked Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes. Not really. Kinda. They're sending someone up from Milwaukee to collect you."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Why is that a problem?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I got to keep you in here with me for three hours," she said. "And the cell over there"-she pointed to the cell by the door, with the sleeping man in it-"that's occupied. He's on suicide watch. I shouldn't put you in with him. But it's not worth the trouble to sign you in to the county and then sign you out again." She shook her head. "And you don't want to go in there"-she pointed to the empty cell in which he'd changed his clothes-"because the can is shot. It stinks in there, doesn't it?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes. It was gross."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It's common humanity, that's what it is. The sooner we get into the new facilities, it can't be too soon for me. One of the women we had in yesterday must've flushed a tampon away. I tell 'em not to. We got bins for that. They clog the pipes. Every damn tampon down that John costs the county a hundred bucks in plumbers' fees. So, I can keep you out here, if I cuff you. Or you can go in the cell." She looked at him. "Your call," she said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'm not crazy about them," he said. "But I'll take the cuffs."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She took a pair from her utility belt, then patted the semiautomatic in its holster, as if to remind him that it was there. "Hands behind your back," she said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The cuffs were a tight fit: he had big wrists. Then she put hobbles on his ankles and sat him down on a bench on the far side of the counter, against the wall. "Now," she said. "You don't bother me, and I won't bother you." She tilted the television so that he could see it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Thanks," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"When we get our new offices," she said, "there won't be none of this nonsense."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The Tonight Show finished. An episode of Cheers began. Shadow had never watched Cheers. He had only ever seen one episode of it-the one where Coach's daughter comes to the bar-although he had seen that several times. Shadow had noticed that you only ever catch one episode of shows you don't watch, over and over, years apart; he thought it must be some kind of cosmic law.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Officer Liz Bute sat back in her chair. She was not obviously dozing, but she was by no means awake, so she did not notice when the gang at Cheers stopped talking and getting off one-liners and just started staring out of the screen at Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Diane, the blonde barmaid who fancied herself an intellectual, was the first to talk. "Shadow," she said. "We were so worried about you. You'd fallen off the world. It's so good to see you again-albeit in bondage and orange couture."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What I figure is the thing to do," pontificated bar bore Cliff, "is to escape in hunting season, when everybody's wearing orange anyway."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow said nothing.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Ah, cat got your tongue, I see," said Diane. "Well, you've led us a merry chase!"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow looked away. Officer Liz had begun, gently, to snore. Carla, the little waitress, snapped, "Hey, jerk-wad! We interrupt this broadcast to show you something that's going to make you piss in your friggin' pants. You ready?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The screen flickered and went black. The words LIVE FEED pulsated in white at the bottom left of screen. A subdued female voice said, in voice-over, "It's certainly not too late to change to the winning side. But you know, you also have the freedom to stay just where you are. That's what it means to be an American. That's the miracle of America. Freedom to believe means the freedom to believe the wrong thing, after all. Just as freedom of speech gives you the right to stay silent."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The picture now showed a street scene. The camera lurched forward, in the manner of handheld video cameras in real-life documentaries.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A man with thinning hair, a tan, and a faintly hangdog expression filled the frame. He was standing by a wall sipping a cup of coffee from a plastic cup. He looked into the camera, and said, "Terrorists hide behind weasel words, like 'freedom fighter.' You and I know that they are murdering scum, pure and simple. We're risking our lives to make a difference."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow recognized the voice. He had been inside the man's head once. Mr. Town sounded different from inside, his voice was deeper, more resonant-but there was no mistaking it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The cameras pulled back to show that Mr. Town was standing outside a brick building on an American street. Above the door was a set-square and compass framing the letter G.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"In position," said somebody offscreen.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Let's see if the cameras inside the hall are rolling," said the female voice-over voice.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The words LIVE FEED continued to blink at the bottom left of the screen. Now the picture showed the interior of a small hall: the room was underlit. Two men sat at a table at the far end of the room. One of them had his back to the camera. The camera zoomed in to them awkwardly. For a moment they were out of focus, and then they became sharp once more. The man facing the camera got up and began to pace, like a bear on a chain. It was Wednesday. He looked as if, on some level, he was enjoying this. As they came into focus the sound came on with a pop.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The man with his back to the screen was saying, "-we are offering is the chance to end this, here and now, with no more bloodshed, no more aggression, no more pain, no more loss of life. Isn't that worth giving up a little?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday stopped pacing and turned. His nostrils flared. "First," he growled, "you have to understand that you are asking me to speak for all of us. Which is manifestly nonsensical. Secondly, what on earth makes you think that I believe that you people are going to keep your word?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The man with his back to the camera moved his head. "You do yourself an injustice," he said. "Obviously you people have no leaders. But you're the one they listen to. They pay attention to you. And as for keeping my word, well, these preliminary talks are being filmed and broadcast live," and he gestured back toward the camera. "Some of your people are watching as we speak. Others will see videotapes. The camera does not lie."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Everybody lies," said Wednesday.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow recognized the voice of the man with his back to the camera. It was Mr. World, the one who had spoken to Town on the cellphone while Shadow was in Town's head.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You don't believe," said Mr. World, "that we will keep our word?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I think your promises were made to be broken and your oaths to be forsworn. But I will keep my word."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Safe conduct is safe conduct," said Mr. World, "and a flag of truce is what we agreed. I should tell you, by the way, that your young protégé is once more in our custody."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday snorted. "No," he said. "He's not."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"We were discussing the ways to deal with the coming paradigm shift. We don't have to be enemies. Do we?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday seemed shaken. He said, "I will do whatever is in my power…"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow noticed something strange about the image of Wednesday on the television screen. A red glint burned on his left eye, the glass one. The dot left a phosphor-dot afterimage as he moved. He seemed unaware of it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It's a big country," said Wednesday, marshaling his thoughts. He moved his head and the red laser-pointer dot slipped to his cheek. Then it edged up to his glass eye once more. "There is room for-"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was a bang, muted by the television speakers, and the side of Wednesday's head exploded. His body tumbled backward.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Mr. World stood up, his back still to the camera, and walked out of shot.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Let's see that again, in slow motion this time," said the announcer's voice, reassuringly.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The words LIVE FEED became REPLAY. Slowly now the red laser pointer traced its bead onto Wednesday's glass eye, and once again the side of his face dissolved into a cloud of blood. Freeze frame.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes, it's still God's Own Country," said the announcer, a news reporter pronouncing the final tag line. "The only question is, which gods?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Another voice-Shadow thought that it was Mr. World's, it had that same half-familiar quality-said, "We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">On Cheers, Coach assured his daughter that she was truly beautiful, just like her mother.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The telephone rang, and Officer Liz sat up with a start. She picked it up. Said, "Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay." Put the phone down. She got up from behind the counter, and said to Shadow, "I'm going to have to put you in the cell. Don't use the can. The Lafayette sheriff's department should be here to collect you soon."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She removed the cuffs and the hobble, locked him into the holding cell. The smell was worse, now that the door was closed.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow sat down on the concrete bed, slipped the Liberty dollar from his sock, and began moving it from finger to palm, from position to position, from hand to hand, his only aim to keep the coin from being seen by anyone who might look in. He was passing the time. He was numb.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He missed Wednesday, then, sudden, and deep. He missed the man's confidence, his attitude. His conviction.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He opened his hand, looked down at Lady Liberty, a silver profile. He closed his fingers over the coin, held it tightly. He wondered if he'd get to be one of those guys who got life for something they didn't do. If he even made it that far. From what he'd seen of Mr. World and Mr. Town, they would have little trouble pulling him out of the system. Perhaps he'd suffer an unfortunate accident on the way to the next holding facility. He could be shot while making a break for it. It did not seem at all unlikely.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was a stir of activity in the room on the other side of the glass. Officer Liz came back in. She pressed a button, a door that Shadow could not see opened, and a black deputy in a brown sheriff's uniform entered and walked briskly over to the desk.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow slipped the dollar coin back into his sock.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The new deputy handed over some papers, Liz scanned them and signed. Chad Mulligan came in, said a few words to the new man, then he unlocked the cell door and walked inside.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Okay. Folk are here to pick you up. Seems you're a matter of national security. You know that?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It'll make a great front-page story for the Lakeside News," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Chad looked at him without expression. "That a drifter got picked up for parole violations? Not much of a story."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"So that's the way it is?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That's what they tell me," said Chad Mulligan. Shadow put his hands in front of him this time, and Chad cuffed him. Chad locked on the ankle hobbles, and a rod from the cuffs to the hobbles.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow thought, They'll take me outside. Maybe I can make a break for it-in hobbles and cuffs and lightweight orange clothes, out into the snow, and even as he thought it he knew how stupid and hopeless it was.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Chad walked him out into the office. Liz had turned the TV off now. The black deputy looked him over. "He's a big guy," he said to Chad. Liz passed the new deputy the paper bag with Shadow's possessions in it, and he signed for it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Chad looked at Shadow, then at the deputy. He said to the deputy, quietly, but loudly enough for Shadow to hear, "Look. I just want to say, I'm not comfortable with the way this is happening."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The deputy nodded. "You'll have to take it up with the appropriate authorities, sir. Our job is simply to bring him in."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Chad made a sour face. He turned to Shadow. "Okay," said Chad. "Through that door and into the sally port."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Out there. Where the car is."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Liz unlocked the doors. "You make sure that orange uniform comes right back here," she said to the deputy. "The last felon we sent down to Lafayette, we never saw the uniform again. They cost the county money." They walked Shadow out to the sally port, where a car sat idling. It wasn't a sheriff's department car. It was a black town car. Another deputy, a grizzled white guy with a mustache, stood by the car, smoking a cigarette. He crushed it out underfoot as they came close, and opened the back door for Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow sat down, awkwardly, his movements hampered by the cuffs and the hobble. There was no grille between the back and the front of the car.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The two deputies climbed into the front of the car. The black deputy started the motor. They waited for the sally port door to open.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Come on, come on," said the black deputy, his fingers drumming against the steering wheel.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Chad Mulligan tapped on the side window. The white deputy glanced at the driver, then he lowered-the window. "This is wrong," said Chad. "I just wanted to say that."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Your comments have been noted, and will be conveyed to the appropriate authorities," said the driver.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The doors to the outside world opened. The snow was still falling, dizzying into the car's headlights. The driver put his foot on the gas, and they were heading back down the street and on to Main Street.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You heard about Wednesday?" said the driver. His voice sounded different, now, older, and familiar. "He's dead."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yeah. I know," said Shadow. "I saw it on TV."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Those fuckers," said the white officer. It was the first thing he had said, and his voice was rough and accented and, like the driver's, it was a voice that Shadow knew. "I tell you, they are fuckers, those fuckers."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Thanks for coming to get me," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Don't mention it," said the driver. In the light of an oncoming car his face already seemed to look older. He looked smaller, too. The last time Shadow had seen him he had been wearing lemon-yellow gloves and a check jacket. "We were in Milwaukee. Had to drive like demons when Ibis called."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You think we let them lock you up and send you to the chair, when I'm still waiting to break your head with my hammer?" asked the white deputy gloomily, fumbling in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes. His accent was Eastern European.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"The real shit will hit the fan in an hour or less," said Mr. Nancy, looking more like himself with each moment, "when they really turn up to collect you. We'll pull over before we get to Highway 53 and get you out of those shackles and back into your own clothes." Czernobog held up a handcuff key and smiled.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I like the mustache," said Shadow. "Suits you."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Czernobog stroked it with a yellowed finger. "Thank you."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Wednesday," said Shadow. "Is he really dead? This isn't some kind of trick, is it?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He realized that he had been holding on to some kind of hope, foolish though it was. But the expression on Nancy's face told him all he needed to know, and the hope was gone.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_30"></div></div></body>
