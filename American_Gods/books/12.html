She has adopted the unassailable position of a nation blessed because it deserves to be blessed; and her sons, whatever other theologies they may affect or disregard, subscribe unreservedly to this national creed.</span></span></span><br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre11"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre4">-Agnes Repplier, Times and Tendencies</span></span></span></p><a class="calibre5"></a><p class="calibre18"><span class="calibre4">Shadow drove west, across Wisconsin and Minnesota and into North Dakota, where the snow-covered hills looked like huge sleeping buffalo, and he and Wednesday saw nothing but nothing and plenty of it for mile after mile. They went south, then, into South Dakota, heading for reservation country.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday had traded the Lincoln Town Car, which Shadow had liked to drive, for a lumbering and ancient Winnebago, which smelled pervasively and unmistakably of male cat, which he didn't enjoy driving at all.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">As they passed their first signpost for Mount Rushmore, still several hundred miles away, Wednesday grunted. "Now that," he said, "is a holy place."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow had thought Wednesday was asleep. He said, "I know it used to be sacred to the Indians."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It's a holy place," said Wednesday. "That's the American Way-they need to give people an excuse to come and worship. These days, people can't just go and see a mountain. Thus, Mister Gutzon Borglum's tremendous presidential faces. Once they were carved, permission was granted, and now the people drive out in their multitudes to see something in the flesh that they've already seen on a thousand postcards."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I knew a guy once. He did weight training at the Muscle Farm, years back. He said that the Dakota Indians, the young men climb up the mountain, then form death-defying human chains off the heads, just so that the guy at the end of the chain can piss on the president's nose."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday guffawed. "Oh, fine! Very fine! Is any specific president the particular butt of their ire?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow shrugged. "He never said."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Miles vanished beneath the wheels of the Winnebago. Shadow began to imagine that he was staying still while the American landscape moved past them at a steady sixty-seven miles per hour. A wintry mist fogged the edges of things.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It was midday on the second day of the drive, and they were almost there. Shadow, who had been thinking, said, "A girl vanished from Lakeside last week, when we were in San Francisco."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Mm?" Wednesday sounded barely interested.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Kid named Alison McGovern. She's not the first kid to vanish there. There have been others. They go in the wintertime."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday furrowed his brow. "It is a tragedy, is it not? The little faces on the milk cartons-although I can't remember the last time I saw a kid on a milk carton-and on the walls of freeway rest areas. 'Have you seen me?' they ask. A deeply existential question at the best of times. 'Have you seen me?' Pull off at the next exit."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow thought he heard a helicopter pass overhead, but the clouds were too low to see anything.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Why did you pick Lakeside?" asked Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I told you. It's a nice quiet place to hide you away. You're off the board there, under the radar."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Why?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Because that's the way it is. Now hang a left," said Wednesday.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow turned left.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"There's something wrong," said Wednesday. "Fuck. Jesus fucking Christ on a bicycle. Slow down, but don't stop."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Care to elaborate?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Trouble. Do you know any alternative routes?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Not really. This is my first time in South Dakota," said Shadow. "And I don't know where we're going."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">On the other side of the hill something flashed redly, smudged by the mist.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Roadblock," said Wednesday. He pushed his hand deeply into first one pocket of his suit, then another, searching for something.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I can stop and turn around."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"We can't turn. They're behind us as well," said Wednesday. "Take your speed down to ten, fifteen miles per hour."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow glanced into the mirror. There were headlights behind them, under a mile back. "Are you sure about this?" he asked.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday snorted. "Sure as eggs is eggs," he said. "As the turkey farmer said when he hatched his first turtle. Ah, success!" and from the bottom of a pocket he produced a small piece of white chalk.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He started to scratch with the chalk on the dashboard of the camper, making marks as if he were solving an algebraic puzzle-or perhaps, Shadow thought, as if he were a hobo, scratching long messages to the other hobos in hobo code-bad dog here, dangerous town, nice woman, soft jail in which to overnightâ€¦</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Okay," said Wednesday. "Now increase your speed to thirty. And don't slow down from that."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">One of the cars behind them turned on its lights and siren and accelerated toward them. "Do not slow down," repeated Wednesday. "They just want us to slow before we get to the roadblock." Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They crested the hill. The roadblock was less than a quarter of a mile away. Twelve cars arranged across the road, and on the side of the road, police cars, and several big black SUVs.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"There," said Wednesday, and he put his chalk away. The dashboard of the Winnebago was now covered with rune-like scratchings.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The car with the siren was just behind them. It had slowed to their speed, and an amplified voice was shouting, "Pull over!" Shadow looked at Wednesday.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Turn right," said Wednesday. "Just pull off the road."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I can't take this thing off-road. We'll tip."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It'll be fine. Take a right. Now!"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow pulled the wheel down with his right hand, and the Winnebago lurched and jolted. For a moment he thought he had been correct, that the camper was going to tip, and then the world through the windshield dissolved and shimmered, like the reflection in a clean pool when the wind brushes the surface.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The clouds and the mist and the snow and the day were gone.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Now there were stars overhead, hanging like frozen spears of light, stabbing the night sky.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Park here," said Wednesday. "We can walk the rest of the way."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow turned off the engine. He went into the back of the Winnebago, pulled on his coat, his boots and gloves. Then he climbed out of the vehicle and said "Okay. Let's go."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday looked at him with amusement and something else-irritation perhaps. Or pride. "Why don't you argue?" asked Wednesday. "Why don't you exclaim that it's all impossible? Why the hell do you just do what I say and take it all so fucking calmly?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Because you're not paying me to ask questions," said Shadow. And then he said, realizing the truth as the words came out of his mouth, "Anyway, nothing's really surprised me since Laura."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Since she came back from the dead?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Since I learned she was screwing Robbie. That one hurt. Everything else just sits on the surface. Where are we going now?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday pointed, and they began to walk. The ground beneath their feet was rock of some kind, slick and volcanic, occasionally glassy. The air was chilly, but not winter-cold. They sidestepped their way awkwardly down a hill. There was a rough path, and they followed it. Shadow looked down to the bottom of the hill.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What the hell is that?" asked Shadow, but Wednesday touched his finger to his lips, shook his head sharply. Silence.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It looked like a mechanical spider, blue metal, glittering LED lights, and it was the size of a tractor. It squatted at the bottom of the hill. Beyond it were an assortment of bones, each with a flame beside it little bigger than a candle-flame, flickering.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday gestured for Shadow to keep his distance from these objects. Shadow took an extra step to the side, which was a mistake on that glassy path, as his ankle twisted and he tumbled down the slope, rolling and slipping and bouncing. He grabbed at a rock as he went past, and the obsidian snag ripped his leather glove as if it were paper.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He came to rest at the bottom of the hill, between the mechanical spider and the bones.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He put a hand down to push himself to his feet, and found himself touching what appeared to be a thighbone with the palm of his hand, and he wasâ€¦</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">â€¦standing in the daylight, smoking a cigarette, and looking at his watch. There were cars all around him, some empty, some not. He was wishing he had not had that last cup of coffee, for he dearly needed a piss, and it was starting to become uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">One of the local law enforcement people came over to him, a big man with frost in his walrus mustache. He had already forgotten the man's name.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I don't know how we could have lost them," says Local Law Enforcement, apologetic and puzzled.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It was an optical illusion," he replies. "You get them in freak weather conditions. The mist. It was a mirage. They were driving down some other road. We thought they were on this one."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Local Law Enforcement looks disappointed. "Oh. I thought it was maybe like an X-Files kinda thing," he says.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Nothing so exciting, I'm afraid." He suffers from occasional hemorrhoids and his ass has just started itching in the way that signals that a flare-up is on the way. He wants to be back inside the Beltway. He wishes there was a tree to go and stand behind: the urge to piss is getting worse. He drops the cigarette and steps on it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Local Law Enforcement walks over to one of the police cars and says something to the driver. They both shake their heads.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He pulls out his telephone, touches the menu, pages down and finds the address entry marked ''Laundry," which had amused him so much when he typed it in-a reference to The Man from U.N.C.LE, and as he looks at it he realizes that it's not from that at all, that was a tailor's, he's thinking of Get Smart, and he still feels weird and slightly embarrassed after all those years about not realizing it was a comedy when he was a kid, and just wanting a shoephoneâ€¦</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A woman's voice on the phone. "Yes?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"This is Mister Town, for Mister World."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There is silence. Town crosses his legs, tugs his belt higher on his belly-got to lose those last ten pounds-and away from his bladder. Then an urbane voice says, "Hello, Mister Town."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"We lost them," says Town. He feels a knot of frustration in his gut: these were the bastards, the lousy dirty sons of bitches who killed Woody and Stone, for Chrissakes. Good men. Good men. He badly wants to fuck Mrs. Wood, but knows it's still too soon after Woody's death to make a move. So he is taking her out for dinner every couple of weeks, an investment in the future, she's just grateful for the attentionâ€¦</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"How?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I don't know. We set up a roadblock, there was nowhere they could have gone and they went there anyway."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Just another one of life's little mysteries. Don't worry. Have you calmed the locals?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Told 'em it was an optical illusion."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"They buy it?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Probably."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was something very familiar about Mr. World's voice-which was a strange thing to think, he'd been working for him directly for two years now, spoken to him every day, of course there was something familiar about his voice.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"They'll be far away by now."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Should we send people down to the rez to intercept them?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Not worth the aggravation. Too many jurisdictional issues, and there are only so many strings I can pull in a morning. We have plenty of time. Just get back here. I've got my hands full at this end trying to organize the policy meeting."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Trouble?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It's a pissing contest. I've proposed that we have it out here. The techies want it in Austin, or maybe San Jose, the players want it in Hollywood, the intangibles want it on Wall Street. Everybody wants it in their own backyard. Nobody's going to give."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You need me to do anything?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Not yet. I'll growl at some of them, stroke others. You know the routine."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes, sir."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Carry on, Town."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The connection is broken.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Town thinks he should have had a S.W.A.T. team to pick off that fucking Winnebago, or land mines on the road, or a tactical friggin' nukuler device, that would have showed those bastards they meant business. It was like Mr. World had once said to him, We are writing the future in Letters of Fire and Mr. Town thinks that Jesus Christ, if he doesn't piss now he'll lose a kidney, it'll just burst, and it was like his pop had said when they were on long journeys, when Town was a kid, out on the interstate, his pop would always say, "My back teeth are afloat," and Mr. Town could hear that voice even now, that sharp Yankee accent saying "I got to take a leak soon. My back teeth are afloat"â€¦</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">â€¦and it was then that Shadow felt a hand opening his own hand, prising it open one finger at a time, off the thighbone it was clutching. He no longer needed to urinate; that was someone else. He was standing under the stars on a glassy rock plain.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday made the signal for silence again. Then he began to walk, and Shadow followed.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was a creak from the mechanical spider, and Wednesday froze. Shadow stopped and waited with him. Green lights flickered and ran up and along its side in clusters. Shadow tried not to breathe too loudly.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He thought about what had just happened. It had been like looking through a window into someone else's mind. And then he thought, Mr. World. It was me who thought his voice sounded familiar. That was my thought, not Town's. That was why that seemed so strange. He tried to identify the voice in his mind, to put it into the category in which it belonged, but it eluded him.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It'll come to me, thought Shadow. Sooner or later, it'll come to me.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The green lights went blue, then red, then faded to a dull red, and the spider settled down on its metallic haunches. Wednesday began to walk forward, a lonely figure beneath the stars, in a broad-brimmed hat, his frayed dark cloak gusting randomly in the nowhere wind, his staff tapping on the glassy rock floor.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">When the metallic spider was only a distant glint in the starlight, far back on the plain, Wednesday said, "It should be safe to speak, now."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Where are we?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Behind the scenes," said Wednesday.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Sorry?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Think of it as being behind the scenes. Like in a theater or something. I just pulled us out of the audience and now we're walking about backstage. It's a shortcut."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"When I touched that bone, I was in the mind of a guy named Town. He's with that spook show. He hates us."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"He's got a boss named Mister World. He reminds me of someone, but I don't know who. I was looking into Town's head-or maybe I was in his head. I'm not certain."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Do they know where we're headed?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I think they're calling off the hunt right now. They didn't want to follow us to the reservation. Are we going to a reservation?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Maybe." Wednesday leaned on his staff for a moment, then continued to walk.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What was that spider thing?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"A pattern manifestation. A search engine."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Are they dangerous?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You only get to be my age by assuming the worst."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow smiled. "And how old would that be?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Old as my tongue," said Wednesday. "And a few months older than my teeth."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You play your cards so close to your chest," said Shadow, "that I'm not even sure that they're really cards at all."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday only grunted.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Each hill they came to was harder to climb.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow began to feel headachy. There was a pounding quality to the starlight, something that resonated with the pulse in his temples and his chest. At the bottom of the next hill he stumbled, opened his mouth to say something and, without warning, he vomited.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday reached into an inside pocket, and produced a small hip flask. "Take a sip of this," he said. "Only a sip."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The liquid was pungent, and it evaporated in his mouth like a good brandy, although it did not taste like alcohol. Wednesday took the flask away, and pocketed it. "It's not good for the audience to find themselves walking about backstage. That's why you're feeling sick. We need to hurry to get you out of here."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They walked faster, Wednesday at a solid trudge, Shadow stumbling from time to time, but feeling better for the drink, which had left his mouth tasting of orange peel, of rosemary oil and peppermint and cloves.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday took his arm. "There," he said, pointing to two identical hillocks of frozen rock-glass to their left. "Walk between those two mounds. Walk beside me."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They walked, and the cold air and bright daylight smashed into Shadow's face at the same time.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They were standing halfway up a gentle hill. The mist had gone, the day was sunny and chill, the sky was a perfect blue. At the bottom of the hill was a gravel road, and a red station wagon bounced along it like a child's toy car. A gust of wood smoke came from a building nearby. It looked as if someone had picked up a mobile home and dropped it on the side of the hill thirty years ago. The home was much repaired, patched, and, in places, added onto.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">As they reached the door it opened, and a middle-aged man with sharp eyes and a mouth like a knife slash looked down at them and said, "Eyah, I heard that there were two white men on their way to see me. Two whites in a Winnebago. And I heard that they got lost, like white men always get lost if they don't put up their signs everywhere. And now look at these two sorry beasts at the door. You know you're on Lakota land?" His hair was gray, and long.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Since when were you Lakota, you old fraud?" said Wednesday. He was wearing a coat and a flap-eared cap, and already it seemed to Shadow unlikely that only a few moments ago under the stars he had been wearing a broad-brimmed hat and a tattered cloak. "So, Whiskey Jack. I'm starving, and my friend here just threw up his breakfast. Are you going to invite us in?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Whiskey Jack scratched an armpit. He was wearing blue jeans, and an undershirt the gray of his hair. He wore moccasins, and he seemed not to notice the cold. Then he said, "I like it here. Come in, white men who lost their Winnebago."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was more wood smoke in the air inside the trailer, and there was another man in there, sitting at a table. The man wore stained buckskins, and was barefoot. His skin was the color of bark.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday seemed delighted. "Well," he said, "it seems our delay was fortuitous. Whiskey Jack and Apple Johnny. Two birds with one stone."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The man at the table, Apple Johnny, stared at Wednesday, then he reached down a hand to his crotch, cupped it and said, "Wrong again. I jes' checked and I got both of my stones, jes' where they oughtta be." He looked up at Shadow, raised his hand, palm out. "I'm John Chapman. You don't mind anything your boss says about me. He's an asshole. Always was an asshole. Always goin' to be an asshole. Some people is jes' assholes, and that's an end of it."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Mike Ainsel," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Chapman rubbed his stubbly chin. "Ainsel," he said. "That's not a name. But it'll do at a pinch. What do they call you?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Shadow."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'll call you Shadow, then. Hey, Whiskey Jack"-but it wasn't really Whiskey Jack he was saying, Shadow realized. Too many syllables. "How's the food looking?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Whiskey Jack took a wooden spoon and lifted the lid off a black iron pot, bubbling away on the range of the wood-burning stove. "It's ready for eating," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He took four plastic bowls and spooned the contents of the pot into the bowls, put them down on the table. Then he opened the door, stepped out into the snow, and pulled a plastic gallon jug from the snowbank. He brought it inside, and poured four large glasses of a cloudy yellow-brown liquid, which he put beside each bowl. Last of all, he found four spoons. He sat down at the table with the other men.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday raised his glass suspiciously. "Looks like piss," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You still drinking that stuff?" asked Whiskey Jack. "You white men are crazy. This is better." Then, to Shadow, "The stew is mostly wild turkey. John here brought the applejack."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It's a soft apple cider," said John Chapman. "I never believed in hard liquor. Makes men mad."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The stew was delicious, and it was very good apple cider. Shadow forced himself to slow down, to chew his food, not to gulp it, but he was more hungry than he would have believed. He helped himself to a second bowl of the stew and a second glass of the cider.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Dame Rumor says that you've been out talking to all manner of folk, offering them all manner of things. Says you're takin' the old folks on the warpath," said John Chapman. Shadow and Whiskey Jack were washing up, putting the leftover stew into Tupperware bowls. Whiskey Jack put the bowls into the snowdrifts outside his front door, and put a milk crate on top of the place he'd pushed them, so he could find them again.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I think that's a fair and judicious summary of events," said Wednesday.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"They'll win," said Whiskey Jack flatly. "They won already. You lost already. Like the white man and my people. Mostly they won. And when they lost, they made treaties. Then they broke the treaties. So they won again. I'm not fighting for another lost cause."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And it's no use you lookin' at me," said John Chapman, "for even if I fought for you-which'n I won't-I'm no use to you. Mangy rat-tailed bastards jes' picked me off and clean forgot me." He stopped. Then he said, "Paul Bunyan." He shook his head slowly and he said it again. "Paul Bunyan." Shadow had never heard two such innocuous words made to sound so damning.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Paul Bunyan?" Shadow said. "What did he ever do?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"He took up head space," said Whiskey Jack. He bummed a cigarette from Wednesday and the two men sat and smoked.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It's like the idiots who figure that hummingbirds worry about their weight or tooth decay or some such nonsense, maybe they just want to spare hummingbirds the evils of sugar," explained Wednesday. "So they fill the hummingbird feeders with fucking NutraSweet. The birds come to the feeders and they drink it. Then they die, because their food contains no calories even though their little tummies are full. That's Paul Bunyan for you. Nobody ever told Paul Bunyan stories. Nobody ever believed in Paul Bunyan. He came staggering out of a New York ad agency in 1910 and filled the nation's myth stomach with empty calories."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I like Paul Bunyan," said Whiskey Jack. "I went on his ride at the Mall of America, few years back. You see big old Paul Bunyan at the top, then you come crashing down. Splash! He's okay by me. I don't mind that he never existed, means he never cut down any trees. Not as good as planting trees though. That's better."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You said a mouthful," said Johnny Chapman.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday blew a smoke ring. It hung in the air, dissipating slowly in wisps and curls. "Damn it, Whiskey Jack, that's not the point and you know it."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'm not going to help you," said Whiskey Jack. "When you get your ass kicked, you can come back here and if I'm still here I'll feed you again. You get the best food in the fall."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday said, "All the alternatives are worse."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You have no idea what the alternatives are," said Whiskey Jack. Then he looked at Shadow. "You are hunting," he said. His voice was roughened by wood smoke and cigarettes.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'm working," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Whiskey Jack shook his head. "You are also hunting something," he said. "There is a debt that you wish to pay."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow thought of Laura's blue lips and the blood on her hands, and he nodded.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Listen. Fox was here first, and his brother was the wolf. Fox said, people will live forever. If they die they will not die for long. Wolf said, no, people will die, people must die, all things that live must die, or they will spread and cover the world, and eat all the salmon and the caribou and the buffalo, eat all the squash and all the corn. Now one day Wolf died, and he said to the fox, quick, bring me back to life. And Fox said, No, the dead must stay dead. You convinced me. And he wept as he said this. But he said it, and it was final. Now Wolf rules the world of the dead and Fox lives always under the sun and the moon, and he still mourns his brother."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday said, "If you won't play, you won't play. We'll be moving on."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Whiskey Jack's face was impassive. "I'm talking to this young man," he said. "You are beyond help. He is not." He turned back to Shadow. "Tell me your dream," said Whiskey Jack.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow said, "I was climbing a tower of skulls. There were huge birds flying around it. They had lightning in their wings. They were attacking me. The tower fell."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Everybody dreams," said Wednesday. "Can we hit the road?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Not everybody dreams of the Wakinyau, the thunder-bird," said Whiskey Jack. "We felt the echoes of it here."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I told you," said Wednesday. "Jesus."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"There's a clutch of thunderbirds in West Virginia," said Chapman, idly. "A couple of hens and an old cock-bird at least. There's also a breeding pair in the land, they used to call it the State of Franklin, but old Ben never got his state, up between Kentucky and Tennessee. 'Course, there was never a great number of them, even at the best of times."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Whiskey Jack reached out a hand the color of red clay and touched Shadow's face, gently. "Eyah," he said. "It's true. If you hunt the thunderbird you could bring your woman back. But she belongs to the wolf, in the dead places, not walking the land."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"How do you know?' asked Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Whiskey Jack's lips did not move. "What did the buffalo tell you?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"To believe."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Good advice. Are you going to follow it?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Kind of. I guess." They were talking without words, without mouths, without sound. Shadow wondered if, for the other two men in the room, they were standing, unmoving, for a heartbeat or for a fraction of a heartbeat.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"When you find your tribe, come back and see me," said Whiskey Jack. "I can help."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I shall."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Whiskey Jack lowered his hand. Then he turned to Wednesday. "Are you going to fetch your Ho Chunk?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"My what?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Ho Chunk. It's what the Winnebago call themselves."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday shook his head. "It's too risky. Retrieving it could be problematic. They'll be looking for it."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Is it stolen?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday looked affronted. "Not a bit of it. The papers are in the glove compartment."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And the keys?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I've got them," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"My nephew, Harry Bluejay, has an '81 Buick. Why don't you give me the keys to your camper? You can take his car."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday bristled. "What kind of trade is that?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Whiskey Jack shrugged. "You know how hard it will be to bring back your camper from where you abandoned it? I'm doing you a favor. Take it or leave it. I don't care." He closed his knife-wound mouth.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday looked angry, and then the anger became rue, and he said, "Shadow, give the man the keys to the Winnebago." Shadow passed the car keys to Whiskey Jack.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Johnny," said Whiskey Jack, "will you take these men down to find Harry Bluejay? Tell him I said, for him to give them his car."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Be my pleasure," said John Chapman.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He got up and walked to the door, picked up a small burlap sack sitting next to it, opened the door, and walked outside. Shadow and Wednesday followed him. Whiskey Jack waited in the doorway. "Hey," he said to Wednesday. "Don't come back here, you. You are not welcome."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday extended his finger heavenward. "Rotate on this," he said affably.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They walked downhill through the snow, pushing their way through the drifts. Chapman walked in front, his bare feet red against the crust-topped snow. "Aren't you cold?" asked Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"My wife was Choctaw," said Chapman.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And she taught you mystical ways to keep out the cold?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Nope. She thought I was crazy," said Chapman. "She used t'say, 'Johnny, why don't you jes' put on boots?' " The slope of the hill became steeper, and they were forced to stop talking. The three men stumbled and slipped on the snow, using the trunks of birch trees on the hillside to steady themselves, and to stop themselves from falling. When the ground became slightly more level, Chapman said, "She's dead now, a'course. When she died I guess maybe I went a mite crazy. It could happen to anyone. It could happen to you." He clapped Shadow on the arm. "By Jesus and Jehosophat, you're a big man."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"So they tell me," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They trudged down that hill for about half an hour, until they reached the gravel road that wound around the base of it, and the three men began to walk along it, toward the cluster of buildings they had seen from high on the hill.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A car slowed and stopped. The woman driving it reached over, wound down the passenger window, and said, "You bozos need a ride?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You are very gracious, madam," said Wednesday. "We're looking for a Mister Harry Bluejay."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"He'll be down at the rec hall," said the woman. She was in her forties, Shadow guessed. "Get in."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They got in. Wednesday took the passenger seat, John Chapman and Shadow climbed into the back. Shadow's legs were too long to sit in the back comfortably, but he did the best he could. The car jolted forward, down the gravel road.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"So where did you three come from?" asked the driver.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Just visiting with a friend," said Wednesday.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Lives on the hill back there," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What hill?" she asked.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow looked back through the dusty rear window, looking back at the hill. But there was no high hill back there; nothing but clouds on the plains.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Whiskey Jack," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Ah," she said. "We call him Inktomi here. I think it's the same guy. My grandfather used to tell some pretty good stories about him. Of course, all the best of them were kind of dirty." They hit a bump in the road, and the woman swore. "You okay back there?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes ma'am," said Johnny Chapman. He was holding onto the backseat with both hands.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Rez roads," she said. "You get used to them."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Are they all like this?" asked Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Pretty much," said the woman. "All the ones around here. And don't you go asking about all the money from casinos, because who in their right mind wants to come all the way out here to go to a casino? We don't see none of that money out here."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'm sorry."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Don't be." She changed gear with a crash and a groan. "You know the white population all around here is falling? You go out there, you find ghost towns. How you going to keep them down on the farm, after they seen the world on their television screens? And it's not worth anyone's while to farm the Badlands anyhow. They took our lands, they settled here, now they're leaving. They go south. They go west. Maybe if we wait for enough of them to move to New York and Miami and L.A. we can take the whole of the middle back without a fight."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Good luck," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They found Harry Bluejay in the rec hall, at the pool table, doing trick shots to impress a group of several girls. He had a blue jay tattooed on the back of his right hand, and multiple piercings in his right ear.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Ho hoka, Harry Bluejay," said John Chapman.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Fuck off, you crazy barefoot white ghost," said Harry Bluejay, conversationally. "You give me the creeps."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There were older men at the far end of the room, some of them playing cards, some of them talking. There were other men, younger men of about Harry Bluejay's age, waiting for their turn at the pool table. It was a full-sized pool table, and a rip in the green baize on one side had been repaired with silver-gray duct tape.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I got a message from your uncle," said Chapman, un-fazed. "He says you're to give these two your car."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There must have been thirty, maybe even forty people in that hall, and now they were every one of them looking intently at their playing cards, or their feet, or their fingernails, and pretending as hard as they could not to be listening.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"He's not my uncle."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A cigarette-smoke fug hung over the hall. Chapman smiled widely, displaying the worst set of teeth that Shadow had seen in a human mouth. "You want to tell your uncle that? He says you're the only reason he stays among the Lakota."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Whiskey Jack says a lot of things," said Harry Bluejay, petulantly. But he did not say Whiskey Jack either. It sounded almost the same, to Shadow's ear, but not quite: Wisakedjak, he thought. That's what they're saying. Not Whiskey Jack at all.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow said, "Yeah. And one of the things he said was that we're trading our Winnebago for your Buick."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I don't see a Winnebago."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"He'll bring you the Winnebago," said John Chapman. "You know he will."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Harry Bluejay attempted a trick shot and missed. His hand was not steady enough. "I'm not the old fox's nephew," said Harry Bluejay. "I wish he wouldn't say that to people."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Better a live fox than a dead wolf," said Wednesday, in a voice so deep it was almost a growl. "Now, will you sell us your car?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Harry Bluejay shivered, visibly and violently. "Sure," he said. "Sure. I was only kidding. I kid a lot, me." He put down the pool cue on the pool table, and took a thick jacket, pulling it out from a cluster of similar jackets hanging from pegs by the door. "Let me get my shit out of the car first," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He kept darting glances at Wednesday, as if he were concerned that the older man were about to explode.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Harry Bluejay's car was parked a hundred yards away. As they walked toward it, they passed a small whitewashed Catholic church, and a man in a priest's collar who stared at them from the doorway as they went past. He was sucking on a cigarette as if he did not enjoy smoking it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Good day to you, father!" called Johnny Chapman, but the man in the collar made no reply; he crushed his cigarette under his heel, picked up the butt and dropped it into the bin beside the door, and went inside.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Harry Bluejay's car was missing its wing mirrors, and its tires were the baldest Shadow had ever seen: perfectly smooth black rubber. Harry Bluejay told them the car drank oil, but as long as you kept pouring oil in, it would just keep running forever, unless it stopped.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Harry Bluejay filled a black garbage bag with shit from the car (said shit including several screw-top bottles of cheap beer, unfinished, a small packet of cannabis resin wrapped in silver foil and badly hidden in the car's ashtray, a skunk tail, two dozen country-and-western cassettes and a battered, yellowing copy of Stranger in a Strange Land). "Sorry I was jerking your chain before," said Harry Bluejay to Wednesday, passing him the car keys. "You know when I'll get the Winnebago?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Ask your uncle. He's the fucking used-car dealer," growled Wednesday.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Wisakedjak is not my uncle," said Harry Bluejay. He took his black garbage bag and went into the nearest house, and closed the door behind him.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They dropped Johnny Chapman in Sioux Falls, outside a whole-food store. Wednesday said nothing on the drive. He was in a black sulk, as he had been since they left Whiskey Jack's place.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">In a family restaurant just outside St. Paul, Shadow picked up a newspaper someone else had put down. He looked at it once, then again, then he showed it to Wednesday,</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Look at that," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday sighed, and looked down at the paper. "I am," he said, "delighted that the air-traffic controllers' dispute has been resolved without recourse to industrial action."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Not that," said Shadow. "Look. It says it's the fourteenth of February."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Happy Valentine's Day."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"So we set out January the what, twentieth, twenty-first. I wasn't keeping track of the dates, but it was the third week of January. We were three days on the road, all told. So how is it the fourteenth of February?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Because we walked for almost a month," said Wednesday. "In the Badlands. Backstage."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Hell of a shortcut," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday pushed the paper away. "Fucking Johnny Appleseed, always going on about Paul Bunyan. In real life Chapman owned fourteen apple orchards. He farmed thousands of acres. Yes, he kept pace with the western frontier, but there's not a story out there about him with a word of truth in it, save that he went a little crazy once. But it doesn't matter. Like the newspapers used to say, if the truth isn't big enough, you print the legend. This country needs its legends. And even the legends don't believe it anymore."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"But you see it."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'm a has-been. Who the fuck cares about me?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow said softly, "You're a god."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday looked at him sharply. He seemed to be about to say something, and then he slumped back in his seat, and looked down at the menu, and said, "So?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It's a good thing to be a god," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Is it?" asked Wednesday, and this time it was Shadow who looked away.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">In a gas station twenty-five miles outside Lakeside, on the wall by the rest rooms, Shadow saw a homemade photocopied notice: a black-and-white photo of Alison McGovern and the handwritten question Have You Seen Me? above it. Same yearbook photograph: smiling confidently, a girl with rubber-band braces on her top teeth who wants to work with animals when she grows up.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Have you seen me?</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow bought a Snickers bar, a bottle of water, and a copy of the Lakeside News. The above-the-fold story, written by Marguerite Olsen, our Lakeside Reporter, showed a photograph of a boy and an older man, out on the frozen lake, standing by an outhouselike ice-fishing shack, and between them they were holding a big fish. They were smiling. Father and Son Catch Local Record Northern Pike. Full story inside.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday was driving. He said, "Read me anything interesting you find in the paper."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow looked carefully, and he turned the pages slowly, but he couldn't find anything.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday dropped him off in the driveway outside his apartment. A smoke-colored cat stared at him from the driveway, then fled when he bent to stroke it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow stopped on the wooden deck outside his apartment and looked out at the lake, dotted here and there with green and brown ice-fishing huts. Many of them had cars parked beside them. On the ice nearer the bridge sat the old green klunker, just as it had sat in the newspaper. "March twenty-third," said Shadow, encouragingly. "Round nine-fifteen in the morning. You can do it."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Not a chance," said a woman's voice. "April third. Six P.M. That way the day warms up the ice." Shadow smiled.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Marguerite Olsen was wearing a ski suit. She was at the far end of the deck, refilling the bird feeder.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I read your article in the Lakeside News on the Town Record Northern Pike."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Exciting, huh?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Well, educational, maybe."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I thought you weren't coming back to us," she said. "You were gone for a while, huh?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"My uncle needed me," said Shadow. "The time kind of got away from us."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She placed the last suet brick in its cage, and began to fill a net sock with thistle seeds from a plastic milk jug. Several goldfinches, olive in their winter coats, twitted impatiently from a nearby fir tree.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I didn't see anything in the paper about Alison McGovern."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"There wasn't anything to report. She's still missing. There was a rumor that someone had seen her in Detroit, but it turned out to be a false alarm."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Poor kid."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Marguerite Olsen screwed the top back onto the gallon jug. "I hope she's dead," she said, matter-of-factly.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow was shocked. "Why?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Because the alternatives are worse."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The goldfinches hopped frantically from branch to branch of the fir tree, impatient for the people to be gone.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">You aren't thinking about Alison, thought Shadow. You're thinking of your son. You're thinking of Sandy.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He remembered someone saying I miss Sandy. Who was that?</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Good talking to you," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yeah," she said. "You too."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">February passed in a succession of short, gray days. Some days the snow fell, most days it didn't. The weather warmed up, and on the good days it got above freezing. Shadow stayed in his apartment until it began to feel like a prison cell, and then, on the days that Wednesday did not need him to travel, he began to walk.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He would walk for much of the day, long trudges out of the town. He walked, alone, until he reached the national forest to the north and the west, or the cornfields and cow pastures to the south. He walked the Lumber County Wilderness Trail, and he walked along the old railroad tracks, and he walked the back roads. A couple of times he even walked along the frozen lake, from north to south. Sometimes he'd see locals or winter tourists or joggers, and he'd wave and say hi. Mostly he saw nobody at all, just crows and finches, and a few times he spotted a hawk feasting on a roadkill possum or raccoon. On one memorable occasion he watched an eagle snatch a silver fish from the middle of the White Pine River, the water frozen at the edges, but still rushing and flowing at the center. The fish wriggled and jerked in the eagle's talons, glittering in the midday sun; Shadow imagined the fish freeing itself and swimming off across the sky, and he smiled, grimly.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">If he walked, he discovered, he did not have to think, and that was just the way he liked it; when he thought, his mind went to places he could not control, places that made him feel uncomfortable. Exhaustion was the best thing. When he was exhausted, his thoughts did not wander to Laura, or to the strange dreams, or to things that were not and could not be. He would return home from walking, and sleep without difficulty and without dreaming.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He ran into Police Chief Chad Mulligan in George's Barber Shop in the town square. Shadow always had high hopes for haircuts, but they never lived up to his expectations. After every haircut he looked more or less the same, only with shorter hair. Chad, seated in the barber's chair beside Shadow's, seemed surprisingly concerned about his own appearance. When his haircut was finished he gazed grimly at his reflection, as if he were preparing to give it a speeding ticket.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It looks good," Shadow told him.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Would it look good to you if you were a woman?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I guess."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They went across the square to Mabel's together, ordered mugs of hot chocolate. Chad said, "Hey. Mike. Have you ever thought about a career in law enforcement?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow shrugged. "I can't say I have," he said. "Seems like there's a whole lot of things you got to know."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Chad shook his head. "You know the main part of police work, somewhere like this? It's just keeping your head. Something happens, somebody's screaming at you, screaming blue murder, you simply have to be able to say that you're sure that it's all a mistake, and you'll just sort it all out if they just step outside quietly. And you have to be able to mean it."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And then you sort it out?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Mostly, that's when you put handcuffs on them. But yeah, you do what you can to sort it out. Let me know if you want a job. We're hiring. And you're the kind of guy we want."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'll keep that in mind, if the thing with my uncle falls through."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They sipped their hot chocolate. Mulligan said, "Say, Mike, what would you do if you had a cousin. Like a widow. And she started calling you?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Calling you how?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"On the phone. Long distance. She lives out of state." His cheeks crimsoned. "I saw her last year at a family wedding. She was married, back then, though, I mean, her husband was still alive, and she's family. Not a first cousin. Pretty distant."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You got a thing for her?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Blush. "I don't know about that."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Well then, put it another way. Does she have a thing for you?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Well, she's said a few things, when she called. She's a very fine-looking woman."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Soâ€¦what are you going to do about it?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I could ask her out here. I could do that, couldn't I? She's kind of said she'd like to come up here."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You're both adults; I'd say go for it."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Chad nodded, and blushed, and nodded again.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The telephone in Shadow's apartment was silent and dead. He thought about getting it connected, but could think of no one he wanted to call. Late one night he picked it up and listened, and was convinced that he could hear a wind blowing and a distant conversation between a group of people talking in voices too low to properly make out. He said, "Hello?" and "Who's there?" but there was no reply, only a sudden silence and then the faraway sound of laughter, so faint he was not certain he was not imagining it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow made more journeys with Wednesday in the weeks that followed.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He waited in the kitchen of a Rhode Island cottage, and listened while Wednesday sat in a darkened bedroom and argued with a woman who would not get out of bed, nor would she let Wednesday or Shadow look at her face. In the refrigerator was a plastic bag filled with crickets, and another filled with the corpses of baby mice.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">In a rock club in Seattle, Shadow watched Wednesday shout his greeting, over the noise of the band, to a young woman with short red hair and blue-spiral tattoos. That talk must have gone well, for Wednesday came away from it grinning delightedly.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Five days later Shadow was waiting in the rental when Wednesday walked, scowling, from the lobby of an office building in Dallas. Wednesday slammed the car door when he got in, and sat there in silence, his face red with rage. He said, "Drive." Then he said, "Fucking Albanians. Like anybody cares."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Three days after that they flew to Boulder, where they had a pleasant lunch with five young Japanese women. It was a meal of pleasantries and politeness, and Shadow walked away from it unsure of whether anything had been agreed to or decided. Wednesday, though, seemed happy enough.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow had begun to look forward to returning to Lakeside. There was a peace there, and a welcome, that he appreciated.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Each morning when he was not traveling he would drive across the bridge to the town square. He would buy two pasties at Mabel's; he would eat one pasty then and there, and drink a coffee. If someone had left a newspaper out he would read it, although he was never interested enough in the news to purchase a newspaper himself.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He would pocket the second pasty, wrapped in its paper bag, and eat it for his lunch.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He was reading USA Today one morning when Mabel said, "Hey, Mike. Where you going today?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The sky was pale blue. The morning mist had left the trees covered with hoarfrost. "I don't know," said Shadow. "Maybe I'll walk the wilderness trail again."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She refilled his coffee. "You ever gone east on County Q? It's kind of pretty out that away. That's the little road that starts acrost from the carpet store on Twentieth Avenue."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No. Never have."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Well," she said, "it's kind of pretty."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It was extremely pretty. Shadow parked his car at the edge of town, and walked along the side of the road, a winding, country road that curled around the hills to the east of the town. Each of the hills was covered with leafless maple trees, bone-white birches, dark firs and pines.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">At one point a small dark cat kept pace with him beside the road. It was the color of dirt, with white forepaws. He walked over to it. It did not run away.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Hey cat," said Shadow, unselfconsciously.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The cat put its head on one side, looked up at him with emerald eyes. Then it hissed-not at him, but at something over on the side of the road, something he could not see.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Easy," said Shadow. The cat stalked away across the road, and vanished into a field of old unharvested corn.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Around the next bend in the road Shadow came upon a tiny graveyard. The headstones were weathered, although several of them had sprays of fresh flowers resting against them. There was no wall about the graveyard, and no fence, only low mulberry trees, planted at the margins, bent over with ice and age. Shadow stepped over the piled-up ice and slush at the side of the road. There were two stone gateposts marking the entry to the graveyard, although there was no gate between them. He walked into the graveyard between the two posts.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He wandered around the graveyard, looking at the headstones. There were no inscriptions later than 1969. He brushed the snow from a solid-looking granite angel, and he leaned against it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He took the paper bag from his pocket, and removed the pasty from it. He broke off the top: it breathed a faint wisp of steam into the wintry air. It smelled really good, too. He bit into it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Something rustled behind him. He thought for a moment it was the cat, but then he smelled perfume, and under the perfume, the scent of something rotten.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Please don't look at me," she said, from behind him.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Hello, Laura," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Her voice was hesitant, perhaps, he thought, even a little scared. She said, "Hello, puppy."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He broke off some pasty. "Would you like some?" he asked.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She was standing immediately behind him, now. "No," she said. "You eat it. I don't eat food anymore."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He ate his pasty. It was good. "I want to look at you," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You won't like it," she told him.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Please?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She stepped around the stone angel. Shadow looked at her, in the daylight. Some things were different and some things were the same. Her eyes had not changed, nor had the crooked hopefulness of her smile. And she was, very obviously, very dead. Shadow finished his pasty. He stood up and tipped the crumbs out of the paper bag, then folded it up and put it back into his pocket.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The time he had spent in the funeral home in Cairo made it easier somehow for him to be in her presence. He did not know what to say to her.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Her cold hand sought his, and he squeezed it gently. He could feel his heart beating in his chest. He was scared, and what scared him was the normality of the moment. He felt so comfortable with her at his side that he would have been willing to stand there forever.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I miss you," he admitted.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'm here," she said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That's when I miss you most. When you're here. When you aren't here, when you're just a ghost from the past or a dream from another life, it's easier then."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She squeezed his fingers.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"So," he asked. "How's death?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Hard," she said. "It just keeps going."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She rested her head on his shoulder, and it almost undid him. He said, "You want to walk for a bit?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Sure." She smiled up at him, a nervous, crooked smile in a dead face.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They walked out of the little graveyard, and made their way back down the road, toward the town, hand in hand. "Where have you been?" she asked.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Here," he said. "Mostly."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Since Christmas," she said, "I kind of lost you. Sometimes I would know where you were, for a few hours, for a few days. You'd be all over. Then you'd fade away again."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I was in this town," he said. "Lakeside. It's a good little town."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Oh," she said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She no longer wore the blue suit in which she had been buried. Now she wore several sweaters, a long, dark skirt, and high, burgundy boots. Shadow commented on them.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Laura ducked her head. She smiled. "Aren't they great boots? I found them in this great shoe store in Chicago."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"So what made you decide to come up from Chicago?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Oh, I've not been in Chicago for a while, puppy. I was heading south. The cold was bothering me. You'd think I'd welcome it. But it's something to do with being dead, I guess. You don't feel it as cold. You feel it as a sort of nothing, and when you're dead I guess the only thing that you're scared of is nothing. I was going to go to Texas. I planned to spend the winter in Galveston. I think I used to winter in Galveston, when I was a kid."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I don't think you did," said Shadow. "You've never mentioned it before."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No? Maybe it was someone else, then. I don't know. I remember seagulls-throwing bread in the air for seagulls, hundreds of them, the whole sky becoming nothing but seagulls as they flapped their wings and snatched the bread from the air." She paused. "If I didn't see it, I guess someone else did."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A car came around the corner. The driver waved them hello. Shadow waved back. It felt wonderfully normal to walk with his wife.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"This feels good," said Laura, as if she was reading his mind.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"When the call came I had to hurry back. I was barely into Texas."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Call?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She looked up at him. Around her neck the gold coin glinted. "It felt like a call," she said. "I started to think about you. About how much I needed to see you. It was like a hunger."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You knew I was here, then?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes." She stopped. She frowned, and her upper teeth pressed into her blue lower lip, biting it gently. She put her head on one side and said, "I did. Suddenly, I did. I thought you were calling me, but it wasn't you, was it?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You didn't want to see me."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It wasn't that." He hesitated. "No. I didn't want to see you. It hurts too much."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The snow crunched beneath their feet and it glittered diamonds as the sunlight caught it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It must be hard," said Laura, "not being alive."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You mean it's hard for you to be dead? Look, I'm still going to figure out how to bring you back, properly. I think I'm on the right track-"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No," she said. "I mean, I'm grateful. And I hope you really can do it. I did a lot of bad stuffâ€¦" She shook her head. "But I was talking about you."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'm alive," said Shadow. "I'm not dead. Remember?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You're not dead," she said. "But I'm not sure that you're alive, either. Not really."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">This isn't the way this conversation goes, thought Shadow. This isn't the way anything goes.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I love you," she said, dispassionately. "You're my puppy. But when you're really dead you get to see things clearer. It's like there isn't anyone there. You know? You're like this big, solid, man-shaped hole in the world." She frowned. "Even when we were together. I loved being with you. You adored me, and you would do anything for me. But sometimes I'd go into a room and I wouldn't think there was anybody in there. And I'd turn the light on, or I'd turn the light off, and I'd realize that you were in there, sitting on your own, not reading, not watching TV, not doing anything."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She hugged him then, as if to take the sting from her words, and she said, "The best thing about Robbie was that he was somebody. He was a jerk sometimes, and he could be a joke, and he loved to have mirrors around when we made love so he could watch himself fucking me, but he was alive, puppy. He wanted things. He filled the space." She stopped, looked up at him, tipped her head a little to one side. "I'm sorry. Did I hurt your feelings?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He did not trust his voice not to betray him, so he simply shook his head.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Good," she said. "That's good."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They were approaching the rest area where he had parked his car. Shadow felt that he needed to say something: I love you, or please don't go, or I'm sorry. The kind of words you use to patch a conversation that had lurched, without warning, into the dark places. Instead he said, "I'm not dead."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Maybe not," she said. "But are you sure you're alive?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Look at me," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That's not an answer," said his dead wife. "You'll know it, when you are."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What now?" he said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Well," she said, "I've seen you now. I'm going south again."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Back to Texas?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Somewhere warm. I don't care."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I have to wait here," said Shadow. "Until my boss needs me."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That's not living," said Laura. She sighed; and then she smiled, the same smile that had been able to tug at his heart no matter how many times he saw it. Every time she smiled at him had been the first time all over again.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He went to put his arm around her, but she shook her head and pulled out of his reach. She sat down on the edge of a snow-covered picnic table, and she watched him drive away.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_26"></div></div></body>
