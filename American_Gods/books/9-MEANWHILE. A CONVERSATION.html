<div class="calibre1"><a class="calibre5"></a><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre4">MEANWHILE. A CONVERSATION.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Dingdong.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"MizCrow?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Miz Samantha Black Crow?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Do you mind if we ask you a few questions, ma'am?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Are you cops? What are you?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"My name is Town. My colleague here is Mister Road. We're investigating the disappearance of two of our associates."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What were their names?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'm sorry?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Tell me their names. I want to know what they were called. Your associates. Tell me their names and maybe I'll help you."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"…Okay. Their names were Mister Stone and Mister Wood. Now, can we ask you some questions?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Do you guys just see things and pick names? 'Oh, you be Mister Sidewalk, he's Mister Carpet, say hello to Mister Airplane'?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Very funny, young lady. First question: we need to know if you've seen this man. Here. You can hold the photograph."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Whoah. Straight on and profile, with numbers on the bottom…And big. He's cute, though. What did he do?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"He was mixed up in a small-town bank robbery, as a driver, some years ago. His two colleagues decided to keep all the loot for themselves and ran out on him. He got angry. Found them. Came close to killing them with his hands. The state cut a deal with the men he hurt: they testified against him. Shadow here got six years. He served three. You ask me, guys like that, they should just lock them up and throw away the key."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I've never heard anyone say that in real life, you know. Not out loud."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Say what, Miz Crow?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">" 'Loot.' It's not a word you ever hear people say. Maybe in movies people say it. Not for real."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"This isn't a movie, Miz Crow."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Black Crow. It's Miz Black Crow. My friends call me Sam."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Got it, Sam. Now about this man-"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"But you aren't my friends. You can call me Miz Black Crow."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Listen, you snot-nosed little-"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It's okay, Mister Road. Sam here-pardon, ma'am-I mean, Miz Black Crow wants to help us. She's a law-abiding citizen."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Ma'am, we know you helped Shadow. You were seen with him, in a white Chevy Nova. He gave you a ride. He bought you dinner. Did he say anything that could help us in our investigation? Two of our best men have vanished."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I never met him."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You met him. Please don't make the mistake of thinking we're stupid. We aren't stupid."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Mm. I meet a lot of people. Maybe I met him and forgot already."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Ma'am, it really is to your advantage to cooperate with us."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Otherwise, you'll have to introduce me to your friends Mister Thumbscrews and Mister Pentothal?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Ma'am, you aren't making this any easier on yourself."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Gee. I'm sorry. Now, is there anything else? 'Cos I'm going to say 'Buh-bye now' and close the door and I figure you two are going to go and get into Mister Car and drive away."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Your lack of cooperation has been noted, ma'am."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Buh-bye now."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Click.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_22"></div></div></body>
