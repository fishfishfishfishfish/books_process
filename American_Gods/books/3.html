The last one kills.</span></span></span><br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre11"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre4">-old saying</span></span></span></p><a class="calibre5"></a><p class="calibre18"><span class="calibre4">There was a thin young woman behind the counter at the Motel America. She told Shadow he had already been checked in by his friend, and gave him his rectangular plastic room key. She had pale blonde hair and a rodentlike quality to her face that was most apparent when she looked suspicious, and eased when she smiled. She refused to tell him Wednesday's room number, and insisted on telephoning Wednesday on the house phone to let him know his guest was here.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday came out of a room down the hall, and beckoned to Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"How was the funeral?" he asked.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It's over," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You want to talk about it?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Good." Wednesday grinned. "Too much talking these days. Talk talk talk. This country would get along much better if people learned how to suffer in silence."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday led the way back to his room, which was across the hall from Shadow's. There were maps all over the room, unfolded, spread out on the bed, taped to the walls. Wednesday had drawn all over the maps in bright marking pens, fluorescent greens and painful pinks and vivid oranges.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I got hijacked by a fat kid," said Shadow. "He says to tell you that you have been consigned to the dungheap of history while people like him ride in their limos down the superhighways of life. Something like that."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Little snot," said Wednesday.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You know him?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday shrugged. "I know who he is." He sat down, heavily, on the room's only chair. "They don't have a clue," he said. "They don't have a fucking clue. How much longer do you need to stay in town?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I don't know. Maybe another week. I guess I need to wrap up Laura's affairs. Take care of the apartment, get rid of her clothes, all that. It'll drive her mother nuts, but the woman deserves it."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday nodded his huge head. "Well, the sooner you're done, the sooner we can move out of Eagle Point. Goodnight."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow walked across the hall. His room was a duplicate of Wednesday's room, down to the print of a bloody sunset on the wall above the bed. He ordered a cheese and meatball pizza, then he ran a bath, pouring all the motel's little plastic bottles of shampoo into the water, making it foam.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He was too big to lie down in the bathtub, but he sat in it and luxuriated as best he could. Shadow had promised himself a bath when he got out of prison, and Shadow kept his promises.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The pizza arrived shortly after he got out of the bath, and Shadow ate it, washing it down with a can of root beer.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow lay in bed, thinking, This is my first bed as a free man, and the thought gave him less pleasure than he had imagined that it would. He left the drapes open, watched the lights of the cars and of the fast food joints through the window glass, comforted to know there was another world out there, one he could walk to anytime he wanted.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow could have been in his bed at home, he thought, in the apartment that he had shared with Laura-in the bed that he had shared with Laura. But the thought of being there without her, surrounded by her things, her scent, her life, was simply too painful…</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Don't go there, thought Shadow. He decided to think about something else. He thought about coin tricks. Shadow knew that he did not have the personality to be a magician: he could not weave the stories that were so necessary for belief, nor did he wish to do card tricks, nor produce paper flowers. But he just wanted to manipulate coins; he liked the craft of it. He started to list the coin vanishes he had mastered, which reminded him of the coin he had tossed into Laura's grave, and then, in his head, Audrey was telling him that Laura had died with Robbie's cock in her mouth, and once again he felt a small hurt in his heart.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Every hour wounds. The last one kills. Where had he heard that?</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He thought of Wednesday's comment and smiled, despite himself: Shadow had heard too many people telling each other not to repress their feelings, to let their emotions out, let the pain go. Shadow thought there was a lot to be said for bottling up emotions. If you did it long enough and deep enough, he suspected, pretty soon you wouldn't feel anything at all.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Sleep took him then, without Shadow noticing.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He was walking…</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He was walking through a room bigger than a city, and everywhere he looked there were statues and carvings and rough-hewn images. He was standing beside a statue of a womanlike thing: her naked breasts hung flat and pendulous on her chest, around her waist was a chain of severed hands, both of her own hands held sharp knives, and, instead of a head, rising from her neck there were twin serpents, their bodies arched, facing each other, ready to attack. There was something profoundly disturbing about the statue, a deep and violent wrongness. Shadow backed away from it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He began to walk through the hall. The carved eyes of those statues that had eyes seemed to follow his every step.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">In his dream, he realized that each statue had a name burning on the floor in front of it. The man with the white hair, with a necklace of teeth about his neck, holding a drum, was Leucotios; the broad-hipped woman with monsters dropping from the vast gash between her legs was Hubur; the ram-headed man holding the golden ball was Hershef.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A precise voice, fussy and exact, was speaking to him, in his dream, but he could see no one.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"These are gods who have been forgotten, and now might as well be dead. They can be found only in dry histories. They are gone, all gone, but their names and their images remain with us."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow turned a corner, and knew himself to be in another room, even vaster than the first. It went on farther than the eye could see. Close to him was the skull of a mammoth, polished and brown, and a hairy ocher cloak, being worn by a small woman with a deformed left hand. Next to that were three women, each carved from the same granite boulder, joined at the waist: their faces had an unfinished, hasty look to them, although their breasts and genitalia had been carved with elaborate care; and there was a flightless bird which Shadow did not recognize, twice his height, with a beak like a vulture's, but with human arms: and on, and on.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The voice spoke once more, as if it were addressing a class, saying, "These are the gods who have passed out of memory. Even their names are lost. The people who worshiped them are as forgotten as their gods. Their totems are long since broken and cast down. Their last priests died without passing on their secrets.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Gods die. And when they truly die they are unmourned and unremembered. Ideas are more difficult to kill than people, but they can be killed, in the end."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was a whispering noise that began then to run through the hall, a low susurrus that caused Shadow, in his dream, to experience a chilling and inexplicable fear. An all-engulfing panic took him, there in the halls of the gods whose very existence had been forgotten-octopus-faced gods and gods who were only mummified hands or falling rocks or forest fires…</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow woke with his heart jackhammering in his chest, his forehead clammy, entirely awake. The red numerals on the bedside clock told him the time was 1:03 A.M. The light of the Motel America sign outside shone through his bedroom window. Disoriented, Shadow got up and walked into the tiny motel bathroom. He pissed without turning on the lights, and returned to the bedroom. The dream was still fresh and vivid in his mind's eye, but he could not explain to himself why it had scared him so.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The light that came into the room from outside was not bright, but Shadow's eyes had become used to the dark. There was a woman sitting on the side of his bed.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He knew her. He would have known her in a crowd of a thousand, or of a hundred thousand. She was still wearing the navy blue suit they had buried her in.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Her voice was a whisper, but a familiar line. "I guess," said Laura, "you're going to ask what I'm doing here."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow said nothing.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He sat down on the room's only chair and, finally, asked, "Is that you?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes," she said. "I'm cold, puppy."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You're dead, babe."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes," she said. "Yes. I am." She patted the bed next to her. "Come and sit by me," she said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No," said Shadow. "I think I'll stay right here for now. We have some unresolved issues to address."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Like me being dead?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Possibly, but I was thinking more of how you died. You and Robbie."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Oh," she said. "That."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow could smell-or perhaps, he thought, he simply imagined that he smelled-an odor of rot, of flowers and preservatives. His wife-his ex-wife…no, he corrected himself, his late wife-sat on the bed and stared at him, unblinking.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Puppy," she said. "Could you-do you think you could possibly get me-a cigarette?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I thought you gave them up."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I did," she said. "But I'm no longer concerned about the health risks. And I think it would calm my nerves. There's a machine in the lobby."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow pulled on his jeans and a T-shirt and went, barefoot, into the lobby. The night clerk was a middle-aged man, reading a book by John Grisham. Shadow bought a pack of Virginia Slims from the machine. He asked the night clerk for a book of matches.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You're in a nonsmoking room," said the clerk. "You make sure you open the window, now." He passed Shadow a book of matches and a plastic ashtray with the Motel America logo on it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Got it," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He went back into his bedroom. She had stretched out now, on top of his rumpled covers. Shadow opened the window and then passed her the cigarettes and the matches. Her fingers were cold. She lit a match and he saw that her nails, usually pristine, were battered and chewed, and there was mud under them.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Laura lit the cigarette, inhaled, blew out the match. She took another puff. "I can't taste it," she said. "I don't think this is doing anything."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'm sorry," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Me too," said Laura. When she inhaled the cigarette tip glowed, and he was able to see her face.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"So," she said. "They let you out."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The tip of the cigarette glowed orange. "I'm still grateful. I should never have got you mixed up in it."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Well," he said, "I agreed to do it. I could have said no." He wondered why he wasn't scared of her: why a dream of a museum could leave him terrified, while he seemed to be coping with a walking corpse without fear.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes," she said. "You could have. You big galoot." Smoke wreathed her face. She was very beautiful in the dim light. "You want to know about me and Robbie?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I guess."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She stubbed out the cigarette in the ashtray. "You were in prison," she said. "And I needed someone to talk to. I needed a shoulder to cry on. You weren't there. I was upset."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'm sorry." Shadow realized something was different about her voice, and he tried to figure out what it was.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I know. So we'd meet for coffee. Talk about what we'd do when you got out of prison. How good it would be to see you again. He really liked you, you know. He was looking forward to giving you back your old job."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And then Audrey went to visit her sister for a week. This was, oh, a year, thirteen months after you'd gone away." Her voice lacked expression; each word was flat and dull, like pebbles dropped, one by one, into a deep well. "Robbie came over. We got drunk together. We did it on the floor of the bedroom. It was good. It was really good."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I didn't need to hear that."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No? I'm sorry. It's harder to pick and choose when you're dead. It's like a photograph, you know. It doesn't matter as much."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It matters to me."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Laura lit another cigarette. Her movements were fluid and competent, not stiff. Shadow wondered, for a moment, if she was dead at all. Perhaps this was some kind of elaborate trick. "Yes," she said. "I see that. Well, we carried on our affair-although we didn't call it that, we did not call it anything-for most of the last two years."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Were you going to leave me for him?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Why would I do that? You're my big bear. You're my puppy. You did what you did for me. I waited three years for you to come back to me. I love you."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He stopped himself from saying I love you, too. He wasn't going to say that. Not anymore. "So what happened the other night?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"The night I was killed?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Well, Robbie and I went out to talk about your welcome-back surprise party. It would have been so good. And I told him that we were done. Finished. That now that you were back that was the way it had to be."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Mm. Thank you, babe."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You're welcome, darling." The ghost of a smile crossed her face. "We got maudlin. It was sweet. We got stupid. I got very drunk. He didn't. He had to drive. We were driving home and I announced that I was going to give him a goodbye blowjob, one last time with feeling, and I unzipped his pants, and I did."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Big mistake."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Tell me about it. I knocked the gearshift with my shoulder, and then Robbie was trying to push me out of the way to put the car back in gear, and we were swerving, and there was a loud crunch and I remember the world started to roll and to spin, and I thought, 'I'm going to die.' It was very dispassionate. I remember that. I wasn't scared. And then I don't remember anything more."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was a smell like burning plastic. It was the cigarette, Shadow realized: it had burned down to the filter. Laura did not seem to have noticed.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What are you doing here, Laura?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Can't a wife come and see her husband?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You're dead. I went to your funeral this afternoon."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes." She stopped talking, stared into nothing. Shadow stood up and walked over to her. He took the smoldering cigarette butt from her fingers and threw it out of the window.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Well?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Her eyes sought his. "I don't know much more than I did when I was alive. Most of the stuff I know now that I didn't know then I can't put into words."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Normally people who die stay in their graves," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Do they? Do they really, puppy? I used to think they did too. Now I'm not so sure. Perhaps." She climbed off the bed and walked over to the window. Her face, in the light of the motel sign, was as beautiful as it had ever been. The face of the woman he had gone to prison for.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">His heart hurt in his chest as if someone had taken it in a fist and squeezed. "Laura…?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She did not look at him. "You've gotten yourself mixed up in some bad things, Shadow. You're going to screw it up, if someone isn't there to watch out for you. I'm watching out for you. And thank you for my present."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What present?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She reached into the pocket of her blouse, and pulled out the gold coin he had thrown into the grave earlier that day. There was still black dirt on it. "I may have it put on a chain. It was very sweet of you."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You're welcome."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She turned then and looked at him with eyes that seemed both to see and not to see him. "I think there are several aspects of our marriage we're going to have to work on."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Babes," he told her. "You're dead."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That's one of those aspects, obviously." She paused. "Okay," she said. "I'm going now. It will be better if I go." And, naturally and easily, she turned and put her hands on Shadow's shoulders, and went up on tiptoes to kiss him goodbye, as she had always kissed him goodbye.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Awkwardly he bent to kiss her on the cheek, but she moved her mouth as he did so and pushed her lips against his. Her breath smelled, faintly, of mothballs.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Laura's tongue flickered into Shadow's mouth. It was cold, and dry, and it tasted of cigarettes and of bile. If Shadow had had any doubts as to whether his wife was dead or not, they ended then.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He pulled back.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I love you," she said, simply. "I'll be looking out for you." She walked over to the motel room door. There was a strange taste in his mouth. "Get some sleep, puppy," she told him. "And stay out of trouble."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She opened the door to the hall. The fluorescent light in the hallway was not kind: beneath it, Laura looked dead, but then, it did that to everyone.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You could have asked me to stay the night," she said, in her cold-stone voice.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I don't think I could," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You will, hon," she said. "Before all this is over. You will." She turned away from him, and walked down the corridor.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow looked out of the doorway. The night clerk kept on reading his John Grisham novel, and barely looked up as she walked past him. There was thick graveyard mud clinging to her shoes. And then she was gone.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow breathed out, a slow sigh. His heart was pounding arrhythmically in his chest. He walked across the hall and knocked on Wednesday's door. As he knocked he got the weirdest notion, that he was being buffeted by black wings, as if an enormous crow was flying through him, out into the hall and the world beyond.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday opened the door. He had a white motel towel wrapped around his waist, but was otherwise naked. "What the hell do you want?" he asked.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Something you should know," said Shadow. "Maybe it was a dream-but it wasn't-or maybe I inhaled some of the fat kid's synthetic toad-skin smoke, or probably I'm just going mad…"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yeah, yeah. Spit it out," said Wednesday. "I'm kind of in the middle of something here."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow glanced into the room. He could see that there was someone in the bed, watching him. A sheet pulled up over small breasts. Pale blonde hair, something rattish about the face. He lowered his voice. "I just saw my wife," he said. "She was in my room."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"A ghost, you mean? You saw a ghost?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No. Not a ghost. She was solid. It was her. She's dead all right, but it wasn't any kind of a ghost. I touched her. She kissed me."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I see." Wednesday darted a look at the woman in the bed. "Be right back, m'dear," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They crossed the hall to Shadow's room. Wednesday turned on the lamps. He looked at the cigarette butt in the ashtray. He scratched his chest. His nipples were dark, old-man nipples, and his chest hair was grizzled. There was a white scar down one side of his torso. He sniffed the air. Then he shrugged.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Okay," he said. "So your dead wife showed up. You scared?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"A little."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Very wise. The dead always give me the screaming mimis. Anything else?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'm ready to leave Eagle Point. Laura's mother can sort out the apartment, all that. She hates me anyway. I'm ready to go when you are."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday smiled. "Good news, my boy. We'll leave in the morning. Now, you should get some sleep. I have some scotch in my room, if you need help sleeping. Yes?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No. I'll be fine."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Then do not disturb me further. I have a long night ahead of me."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Good night," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Exactly," said Wednesday, and he closed the door as he went out.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow sat down on the bed. The smell of cigarettes and preservatives lingered in the air. He wished that he were mourning Laura: it seemed more appropriate than being troubled by her or, he admitted it to himself now that she had gone, just a little scared by her. It was time to mourn. He turned the lights out, and lay on the bed, and thought of Laura as she was before he went to prison. He remembered their marriage when they were young and happy and stupid and unable to keep their hands off each other.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It had been a very long time since Shadow had cried, so long he thought he had forgotten how. He had not even wept when his mother died.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">But he began to cry now, in painful, lurching sobs, and for the first time since he was a small boy, Shadow cried himself to sleep.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_11"></div></div></body>
