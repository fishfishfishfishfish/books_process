<div class="calibre1"><a class="calibre5"></a><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre4">COMING TO AMERICA</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">14,000 B.C.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Cold it was, and dark, when the vision came to her, for in the far north daylight was a gray dim time in the middle of the day that came, and went, and came again: an interlude between darknesses.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They were not a large tribe as these things were counted then: nomads of the Northern Plains. They had a god, who was the skull of a mammoth, and the hide of a mammoth fashioned into a rough cloak. Nunyunnini, they called him. When they were not traveling, he rested on a wooden frame, at man height.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She was the holy woman of the tribe, the keeper of its secrets, and her name was Atsula, the fox. Atsula walked before the two tribesmen who carried their god on long poles, draped with bearskins, that it should not be seen by profane eyes, nor at times when it was not holy.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They roamed the tundra, with their tents. The finest of the tents was made of caribou hide, and it was the holy tent, and there were four of them inside it: Atsula, the priestess, Gugwei, the tribal elder, Yanu, the war leader, and Kalanu, the scout. She called them there, the day after she had her vision.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Atsula scraped some lichen into the fire, then she threw in dried leaves with her withered left hand: they smoked, with an eye-stinging gray smoke, and gave off an odor that was sharp and strange. Then she took a wooden cup from the wooden platform, and she passed it to Gugwei. The cup was half filled with a dark yellow liquid.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Atsula had found the pungh mushrooms, each with seven spots, only a true holy woman could find a seven-spotted mushroom-and had picked them at the dark of the moon, and dried them on a string of deer cartilage.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Yesterday, before she slept, she had eaten the three dried mushroom caps. Her dreams had been confused and fearful things, of bright lights moving fast, of rock mountains filled with lights spearing upward like icicles. In the night she had woken, sweating, and needing to make water. She squatted over the wooden cup and filled it with her urine. Then she placed the cup outside the tent, in the snow, and returned to sleep.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">When she woke, she picked the lumps of ice out from the wooden cup, leaving a darker, more concentrated liquid behind.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It was this liquid she passed around, first to Gugwei, then to Yanu and to Kalanu. Each of them took a large gulp of the liquid, then Atsula took the final draft. She swallowed it, and poured what was left on the ground in front of their god, a libation to Nunyunnini.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They sat in the smoky tent, waiting for their god to speak. Outside, in the darkness, the wind wailed and breathed.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Kalanu, the scout, was a woman who dressed and walked as a man: she had even taken Dalani, a fourteen-year-old maiden, to be her wife. Kalanu blinked her eyes tightly, then she got up and walked over to the mammoth skull. She pulled the mammoth-hide cloak over herself, and stood so her head was inside the mammoth skull.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"There is evil in the land," said Nunyunnini in Kalanu's voice. "Evil, such that if you stay here, in the land of your mothers and your mother's mothers, you shall all perish."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The three listeners grunted.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Is it the slavers? Or the great wolves?" asked Gugwei, whose hair was long and white, and whose face was as wrinkled as the gray skin of a thorn tree.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It is not the slavers," said Nunyunnini, old stone-hide. "It is not the great wolves."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Is it a famine? Is a famine coming?" asked Gugwei.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Nunyunnini was silent. Kalanu came out of the skull and waited with the rest of them.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Gugwei put on the mammoth-hide cloak and put his head inside the skull.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It is not a famine as you know it," said Nunyunnini, through Gugwei's mouth, "although a famine will follow."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Then what is it?" asked Yanu. "I am not afraid. I will stand against it. We have spears, and we have throwing rocks. Let a hundred mighty warriors come against us, still we shall prevail. We shall lead them into the marshes, and split their skulls with our flints."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It is not a man thing," said Nunyunnini, in Gugwei's old voice. "It will come from the skies, and none of your spears or your rocks will protect you."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"How can we protect ourselves?" asked Atsula. "I have seen flames in the skies. I have heard a noise louder than ten thunderbolts. I have seen forests flattened and rivers boil."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Aiâ€¦," said Nunyunnini, but he said no more. Gugwei came out of the skull, bending stiffly, for he was an old man, and his knuckles were swollen and knotted.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was silence. Atsula threw more leaves on the fire, and the smoke made their eyes tear.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Then Yanu strode to the mammoth head, put the cloak about his broad shoulders, put his head inside the skull. His voice boomed. "You must journey," said Nunyunnini. "You must travel to sunward. Where the sun rises, there you will find a new land, where you will be safe. It will be a long journey: the moon will swell and empty, die and live, twice, and there will be slavers and beasts, but I shall guide you and keep you safe, if you travel toward the sunrise."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Atsula spat on the mud of the floor, and said, "No." She could feel the god staring at her. "No," she said. "You are a bad god to tell us this. We will die. We will all die, and then who will be left to carry you from high place to high place, to raise your tent, to oil your great tusks with fat?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The god said nothing. Atsula and Yanu exchanged places. Atsula's face stared out through the yellowed mammoth bone.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Atsula has no faith," said Nunyunnini in Atsula's voice. "Atsula shall die before the rest of you enter the new land, but the rest of you shall live. Trust me: there is a land to the east that is manless. This land shall be your land and the land of your children and your children's children, for seven generations, and seven sevens. But for Atsula's faithlessness, you would have kept it forever. In the morning, pack your tents and your possessions, and walk toward the sunrise."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">And Gugwei and Yanu and Kalanu bowed their heads and exclaimed at the power and wisdom of Nunyunnini.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The moon swelled and waned and swelled and waned once more. The people of the tribe walked east, toward the sunrise, struggling through the icy winds, which numbed their exposed skin. Nunyunnini had promised them truly: they lost no one from the tribe on the journey, save for a woman in childbirth, and women in childbirth belong to the moon, not to Nunyunnini.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They crossed the land bridge.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Kalanu had left them at first light to scout the way. Now the sky was dark, and Kalanu had not returned, but the night sky was alive with lights, knotting and flickering and winding, flux and pulse, white and green and violet and red. Atsula and her people had seen the northern lights before, but they were still frightened by them, and this was a display like they had never seen before.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Kalanu returned to them, as the lights in the sky formed and flowed.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Sometimes," she said to Atsula, "I feel that I could simply spread my arms and fall into the sky."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That is because you are a scout," said Atsula, the priestess. "When you die, you shall fall into the sky and become a star, to guide us as you guide us in life."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"There are cliffs of ice to the east, high cliffs," said Kalanu, her raven-black hair worn long, as a man would wear it. "We can climb them, but it will take many days."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You shall lead us safely," said Atsula. "I shall die at the foot of the cliff, and that shall be the sacrifice that takes you into the new lands."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">To the west of them, back in the lands from which they had come, where the sun had set hours before, there was a flash of sickly yellow light, brighter than lightning, brighter than daylight. It was a burst of pure brilliance that forced the folk on the land bridge to cover their eyes and spit and exclaim. Children began to wail.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That is the doom that Nunyunnini warned us of," said Gugwei the old. "Surely he is a wise god and a mighty one."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"He is the best of all gods," said Kalanu. "In our new land we shall raise him up on high, and we shall polish his tusks and skull with fish oil and animal fat, and we shall tell our children, and our children's children and our seventh children's children, that Nunyunnini is the mightiest of all gods, and shall never be forgotten."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Gods are great," said Atsula, slowly, as if she were imparting a great secret. "But the heart is greater. For it is from our hearts they come, and to our hearts they shall returnâ€¦"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">And there is no telling how long she might have continued in this blasphemy, had it not been interrupted in a manner that brooked no argument.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The roar that erupted from the west was so loud that ears bled, that the people could hear nothing for some time, temporarily blinded and deafened but alive, knowing that they were luckier than the tribes to the west of them.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It is good," said Atsula, but she could not hear the words inside her head.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Atsula died at the foot of the cliffs when the spring sun was at its zenith. She did not live to see the New World, and the tribe walked into those lands with no holy woman.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They scaled the cliffs, and they went south and west, until they found a valley with fresh water, and rivers that teemed with silver fish, and deer that had never seen man before and were so tame it was necessary to spit and to apologize to their spirits before killing them.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Dalani gave birth to three boys, and some said that Kalanu had performed the final magic and could do the man-thing with her bride; while others said that old Gugwei was not too old to keep a young bride company when her husband was away; and certainly once Gugwei died, Dalani had no more children.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">And the ice times came and the ice times went, and the people spread out across the land, and formed new tribes and chose new totems: ravens and foxes and ground sloths and great cats and buffalo, each a beast that marked a tribe's identity, each beast a god.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The mammoths of the new lands were bigger, and slower, and more foolish than the mammoth of the Siberian plains, and the pungh mushrooms, with their seven spots, were not to be found in the new lands, and Nunyunnini did not speak to the tribe any longer.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">And in the days of the grandchildren of Dalani and Kalanu's grandchildren, a band of warriors, members of a big and prosperous tribe, returning from a slaving expedition in the north to their home in the south, found the valley of the first people: they killed most of the men, and they took the women and many of the children captive.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">One of the children, hoping for clemency, took them to a cave in the hills in which they found a mammoth skull, the tattered remnants of a mammoth-skin cloak, a wooden cup, and the preserved head of Atsula the oracle.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">While some of the warriors of the new tribe were for taking the sacred objects away with them, stealing the gods of the first people and owning their power, others counseled against it, saying that they would bring nothing but ill luck and the malice of their own god (for these were the people of a raven tribe, and ravens are jealous gods).</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">So they threw the objects down the side of the hill, into a deep ravine, and took the survivors of the first people with them on their long journey south. And the raven tribes, and the fox tribes, grew more powerful in the land, and soon Nunyunnini was entirely forgotten.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_31"></div></div></body>
