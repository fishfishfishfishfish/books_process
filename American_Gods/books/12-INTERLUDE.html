The storm was lowering and nobody knew it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A falling girder in Manhattan closed a street for two days. It killed two pedestrians, an Arab taxi driver and the taxi driver's passenger.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A trucker in Denver was found dead in his home. The murder instrument, a rubber-gripped claw-headed hammer, had been left on the floor beside his corpse. His face was untouched, but the back of his head was completely destroyed, and several words in a foreign alphabet were written on the bathroom mirror in brown lipstick.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">In a postal sorting station in Phoenix, Arizona, a man went crazy, went postal as they said on the evening news, and shot Terry "The Troll" Evensen, a morbidly obese, awkward man who lived alone in a trailer. Several other people in the sorting station were fired on, but only Evensen was killed. The man who fired the shots-first thought to be a disgruntled postal worker-was not caught, and was never identified.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Frankly," said Terry "The Troll" Evensen's supervisor, on the News at Five, "if anyone around here was gonna go postal, we would have figured it was gonna be the Troll. Okay worker, but a weird guy. I mean, you never can tell, huh?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">That interview was cut when the segment was repeated, later that evening.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A community of nine anchorites in Montana was found dead. Reporters speculated that it was a mass suicide, but soon the cause of death was reported as carbon monoxide poisoning from an elderly furnace.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A crypt was defiled in the Key West graveyard.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">An Amtrak passenger train hit a UPS truck in Idaho, killing the driver of the truck. None of the passengers was seriously injured.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It was still a cold war at this stage, a phony war, nothing that could be truly won or lost.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The wind stirred the branches of the tree. Sparks flew from the fire. The storm was coming.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The Queen of Sheba, half-demon, they said, on her father's side, witch woman, wise woman, and queen, who ruled Sheba when Sheba was the richest land there ever was, when its spices and its gems and scented woods were taken by boat and camel-back to the corners of the earth, who was worshiped even when she was alive, worshiped as a living goddess by the wisest of kings, stands on the sidewalk of Sunset Boulevard at 2:00 A.M. staring blankly out at the traffic like a slutty plastic bride on a black-and-neon wedding cake. She stands as if she owns the sidewalk and the night that surrounds her.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">When someone looks straight at her, her lips move, as if she is talking to herself. When men in cars drive past her she makes eye contact and she smiles.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It's been a long night.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It's been a long week, and a long four thousand years.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She is proud that she owes nothing to anyone. The other girls on the street, they have pimps, they have habits, they have children, they have people who take what they make. Not her.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There is nothing holy left in her profession. Not anymore.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A week ago the rains began in Los Angeles, slicking the streets into road accidents, crumbling the mud from the hillsides and toppling houses into canyons, washing the world into the gutters and storm drains, drowning the bums and the homeless camped down in the concrete channel of the river. When the rains come in Los Angeles they always take people by surprise.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Bilquis has spent the last week inside. Unable to stand on the sidewalk, she has curled up in her bed in the room the color of raw liver, listening to the rain pattering on the metal box of the window air conditioner and placing personals on the Internet. She has left her invitations on adult-friendfinder.com, LA-escorts.com, Classyhollywoodbabes.com, has given herself an anonymous e-mail address. She was proud of herself for negotiating the new territories, but remains nervous-she has spent a long time avoiding anything that might resemble a paper trail. She has never even taken a small ad in the back pages of the LA. Weekly, preferring to pick out her own customers, to find by eye and smell and touch the ones who will worship her as she needs to be worshiped, the ones who will let her take them all the wayâ€¦</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">And it occurs to her now, standing and shivering on the street comer (for the late February rains have left off, but the chill they brought with them remains) that she has a habit as bad as that of the smack whores and the crack whores, and this distresses her, and her lips begin to move again. If you were close enough to her ruby-red lips you would hear her say,</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I will rise now and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek the one I love." She is whispering that, and she whispers, "By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth. Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth. My beloved is mine and I am his."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Bilquis hopes that the break in the rains will bring the Johns back. Most of the year she walks the same two or three blocks on Sunset, enjoying the cool L.A. nights. Once a month she pays off an officer in the LAPD, who replaced the last guy she used to pay off, who had vanished. His name had been Jerry LeBec, and his disappearance had been a mystery to the LAPD. He had become obsessed with Bilquis, had taken to following her on foot. One afternoon she woke, startled by a noise, and opened the door to her apartment, and found Jerry LeBec in civilian clothes kneeling and swaying on the worn carpet, his head bowed, waiting for her to come out. The noise she had heard was the noise of his head, thumping against her door as he rocked back and forth on his knees.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She stroked his hair and told him to come inside, and later she put his clothes into a black plastic garbage bag and tossed them into a Dumpster behind a hotel several blocks away. His gun and his wallet she put into a grocery store bag. She poured used coffee grounds and food waste on top of them, folded the top of the bag, and dropped it into a trash can at a bus stop.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She kept no souvenirs.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The orange night sky glimmers to the west with distant lightning, somewhere out to sea, and Bilquis knows that the rain will be starting soon. She sighs. She does not want to be caught in the rain. She will return to her apartment, she decides, and take a bath, and shave her legs-it seems to her she is always shaving her legs-and sleep.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She begins to walk up a side street, walking up the hillside to where her car is parked.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Headlights come up behind her, slowing as they approach her, and she turns her face to the street and smiles. The smile freezes when she sees the car is a white stretch limo. Men in stretch limos want to fuck in stretch limos, not in the privacy of Bilquis's shrine. Still, it might be an investment. Something for the future.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A tinted window hums down and Bilquis walks over to the limo, smiling. "Hey, honey," she says. "You looking for something?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Sweet loving," says a voice from the back of the stretch. She peers inside, as much as she can through the open window: she knows a girl who got into a stretch with five drunk football players and got hurt real bad, but there's only one John in there that she can see, and he looks kind of on the young side. He doesn't feel like a worshiper, but money, good money that's passed from his hand to hers, that's an energy in its own right-baraka, they called it, once on a time-which she can use and frankly these days, every little helps.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"How much?" he asks.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Depends on what you want and how long you want it for," she says. "And whether you can afford it." She can smell something smoky drifting out of the limo window. It smells like burning wires and overheating circuit boards. The door is pushed open from inside.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I can pay for anything I want," says the John. She leans into the car and looks around. There's nobody else in there, just the John, a puffy-faced kid who doesn't even look old enough to drink. Nobody else, so she gets in.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Rich kid, huh?" she says.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Richer than rich," he tells her, edging along the leather seat toward her. He moves awkwardly. She smiles at him.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Mm. Makes me hot, honey," she tells him. "You must be one of them dot coms I read about?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He preens then, puffs like a bullfrog. "Yeah. Among other things. I'm a technical boy." The car moves off.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"So," he says. "Tell me, Bilquis, how much just to suck my cock?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What you call me?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Bilquis," he says, again. And then he sings, in a voice not made for singing, "You are an immaterial girl living in a material world." There is something rehearsed about his words, as if he's practiced this exchange in front of a mirror.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She stops smiling, and her face changes, becomes wiser, sharper, harder. "What do you want?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I told you. Sweet loving."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'll give you whatever you want," she says. She needs to get out of the limo. It's moving too fast for her to throw herself from the car, she figures, but she'll do it if she can't talk her way out of this. Whatever's happening here, she doesn't like it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What I want. Yes." He pauses. His tongue runs over his lips. "I want a clean world. I want to own tomorrow. I want evolution, devolution, and revolution. I want to move our kind from the fringes of the slipstream to the higher ground of the mainstream. You people are underground. That's wrong. We need to take the spotlight and shine. Front and center. You people have been so far underground for so long you've lost the use of your eyes."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"My name's Ayesha," she says. "I don't know what you're talking about. There's another girl on that corner, her name's Bilquis. We could go back to Sunset, you could have both of usâ€¦"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Oh, Bilquis," he says, and he sighs, theatrically. "There's only so much belief to go around. They're reaching the end of what they can give us. The credibility gap." And then he sings, once again, in his tuneless nasal voice, "You are an analog girl, living in a digital world." The limo takes a corner too fast, and he tumbles across the seat into her. The driver of the car is hidden behind tinted glass. An irrational conviction strikes her, that nobody is driving the car, that the white limo is driving through Beverly Hills like Herbie the Love Bug, under its own power.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Then the John reaches out his hand and taps on the tinted glass.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The car slows, and before it has stopped moving Bilquis has pushed open the door and she half jumps, half falls out onto the blacktop. She's on a hillside road. To the left of her is a steep hill, to the right is a sheer drop. She starts to run down the road.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The limo sits there, unmoving.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It starts to rain, and her high heels slip and twist beneath her. She kicks them off, and runs, soaked to the skin, looking for somewhere she can get off the road. She's scared. She has power, true, but it's hunger-magic, cunt-magic. It has kept her alive in this land for so long, but for everything else she uses her sharp eyes and her mind, her height and her presence.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There's a metal guardrail at knee height on her right, to stop cars from tumbling over the side of the hill, and now the rain is running down the hill road turning it into a river, and the soles of her feet have started to bleed.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The lights of L.A. are spread out in front of her, a twinkling electrical map of an imaginary kingdom, the heavens laid out right here on earth, and she knows that all she needs to be safe is to get off the road.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">I am black but comely, she mouths to the night and the rain. I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys. Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A fork of lightning burns greenly across the night sky. She loses her footing, slides several feet, skinning her leg and elbow, and she is getting to her feet when she sees the lights of the car descending the hill toward her. It's coming down too fast for safety and she wonders whether to throw herself to the right, where it could crush her against the hillside, or the left, where she might tumble down the gully. She runs across the road, intending to push herself up the wet earth, to climb, when the white stretch limo comes fish-tailing down the slick hillside road, hell, it must be doing eighty, maybe even aquaplaning on the surface of the road, and she's pushing her hands into a handful of weeds and earth, and she's going to get up and away, she knows, when the wet earth crumbles and she tumbles back down onto the road.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The car hits her with an impact that crumples the grille and tosses her into the air like a glove puppet. She lands on the road behind the limo, and the impact shatters her pelvis, fractures her skull. Cold rainwater runs over her face.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She begins to curse her killer: curse him silently, as she cannot move her lips. She curses him in waking and in sleeping, in living and in death. She curses him as only someone who is half-demon on her father's side can curse.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A car door slams. Someone approaches her. "You were an analog girl," he sings again, tunelessly, "living in a digital world." And then he says, "You fucking madonnas. All you fucking madonnas." He walks away.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The car door slams.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The limo reverses, and runs back over her, slowly, for the first time. Her bones crunch beneath the wheels. Then the limo comes back down the hill toward her.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">When, finally, it drives away down the hill, all it leaves behind on the road is the smeared red meat of roadkill, barely recognizable as human, and soon even that will be washed away by the rain.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_27"></div></div></body>
