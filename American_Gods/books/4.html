It was eight in the morning, and the world was misty and chill.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You still ready to leave Eagle Point?" asked Wednesday. "I have some calls to make, if you are. Friday today. Friday's a free day. A woman's day. Saturday tomorrow. Much to do on Saturday."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'm ready," said Shadow. "Nothing keeping me here."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday heaped his plate high with several kinds of breakfast meats. Shadow took some melon, a bagel, and a packet of cream cheese. They went and sat down in a booth.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That was some dream you had last night," said Wednesday.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes," said Shadow. "It was." Laura's muddy footprints had been visible on the motel carpet when he got up that morning, leading from his bedroom to the lobby and out the door.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"So," said Wednesday. "Why'd they call you Shadow?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow shrugged. "It's a name," he said. Outside the plate glass the world in the mist had become a pencil drawing executed in a dozen different grays with, here and there, a smudge of electric red or pure white. "How'd you lose your eye?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday shoveled half a dozen pieces of bacon into his mouth, chewed, wiped the fat from his lips with the back of his hand. "Didn't lose it," he said. "I still know exactly where it is."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"So what's the plan?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday looked thoughtful. He ate several vivid pink slices of ham, picked a fragment of meat from his beard, dropped it onto his plate. "Plan is as follows. Tomorrow night we shall be meeting with a number of persons preeminent in their respective fields-do not let their demeanor intimidate you. We shall meet at one of the most important places in the entire country. Afterward we shall wine and dine them. I need to enlist them in my current enterprise."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And where is this most important place?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You'll see, m'boy. I said one of them. Opinions are justifiably divided. I have sent word to my colleagues. We'll stop off in Chicago on the way, as I need to pick up some money. Entertaining, in the manner we shall need to entertain, will take more ready cash than I currently have available. Then on to Madison." Wednesday paid and they left, walked back across the road to the motel parking lot. Wednesday tossed Shadow the car keys.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He drove down to the freeway and out of town.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You going to miss it?" asked Wednesday. He was sorting through a folder filled with maps.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"The town? No. I didn't really ever have a life here. I was never in one place too long as a kid, and I didn't get here until I was in my twenties. So this town is Laura's."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Let's hope she stays here," said Wednesday.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It was a dream," said Shadow. "Remember."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That's good," said Wednesday. "Healthy attitude to have. Did you fuck her last night?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow took a breath. Then, "That is none of your damn business. And no."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Did you want to?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow said nothing at all. He drove north, toward Chicago. Wednesday chuckled, and began to pore over his maps, unfolding and refolding them, making occasional notes on a yellow legal pad with a large silver ballpoint pen.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Eventually he was finished. He put his pen away, put the folder on the backseat. "The best thing about the states we're heading for," said Wednesday, "Minnesota, Wisconsin, all around there, is they have the kind of women I liked when I was younger. Pale-skinned and blue-eyed, hair so fair it's almost white, wine-colored lips, and round, full breasts with the veins running through them like a good cheese."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Only when you were younger?" asked Shadow. "Looked like you were doing pretty good last night."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes." Wednesday smiled. "Would you like to know the secret of my success?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You pay them?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Nothing so crude. No, the secret is charm. Pure and simple."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Charm, huh? Well, like they say, you either got it or you ain't."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Charms can be learned," said Wednesday.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow tuned the radio to an oldies station, and listened to songs that were current before he was born. Bob Dylan sang about a hard rain that was going to fall, and Shadow wondered if that rain had fallen yet, or if it was something that was still going to happen. The road ahead of them was empty and the ice crystals on the asphalt glittered like diamonds in the morning sun.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Chicago happened slowly, like a migraine. First they were driving through countryside, then, imperceptibly, the occasional town became a low suburban sprawl, and the sprawl became the city.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">They parked outside a squat black brownstone. The sidewalk was clear of snow. They walked to the lobby. Wednesday pressed the top button on the gouged metal intercom box. Nothing happened. He pressed it again. Then, experimentally, he began to press the other buttons, for other tenants, with no response.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It's dead," said a gaunt old woman, coming down the steps. "Doesn't work. We call the super, ask him when he going to fix, when he going to mend the heating, he does not care, goes to Arizona for the winter for his chest." Her accent was thick, Eastern European, Shadow guessed.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday bowed low. "Zorya, my dear, may I say how unutterably beautiful you look? A radiant creature. You have not aged."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The old woman glared at him. "He don't want to see you. I don't want to see you neither. You bad news."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That's because I don't come if it isn't important."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The woman sniffed. She carried an empty string shopping bag, and wore an old red coat, buttoned up to her chin. She looked at Shadow suspiciously.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Who is the big man?" she asked Wednesday. "Another one of your murderers?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You do me a deep disservice, good lady. This gentleman is called Shadow. He is working for me, yes, but on your behalf. Shadow, may I introduce you to the lovely Miss Zorya Vechernyaya."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Good to meet you," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Birdlike, the old woman peered up at him. "Shadow," she said. "A good name. When the shadows are long, that is my time. And you are the long shadow." She looked him up and down, then she smiled. "You may kiss my hand," she said, and extended a cold hand to him.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow bent down and kissed her thin hand. She had a large amber ring on her middle finger.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Good boy," she said. "I am going to buy groceries. You see, I am the only one of us who brings in any money. The other two cannot make money fortune-telling. This is because they only tell the truth, and the truth is not what people want to hear. It is a bad thing, and it troubles people, so they do not come back. But I can lie to them, tell them what they want to hear. So I bring home the bread. Do you think you will be here for supper?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I would hope so," said Wednesday.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Then you had better give me some money to buy more food," she said. "I am proud, but I am not stupid. The others are prouder than I am, and he is the proudest of all. So give me money and do not tell them that you give me money."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday opened his wallet, and reached in. He took out a twenty. Zorya Vechernyaya plucked it from his fingers, and waited. He took out another twenty and gave it to her.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Is good," she said. "We will feed you like princes. Now, go up the stairs to the top. Zorya Utrennyaya is awake, but our other sister is still asleep, so do not be making too much noise."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow and Wednesday climbed the dark stairs. The landing two stories up was half filled with black plastic garbage bags and it smelled of rotting vegetables.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Are they gypsies?" asked Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Zorya and her family? Not at all. They're not Rom. They're Russian. Slavs, I believe."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"But she does fortune-telling."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Lots of people do fortune-telling. I dabble in it myself." Wednesday was panting as they went up the final flight of stairs. "I'm out of shape."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The landing at the top of the stairs ended in a single door painted red, with a peephole in it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday knocked at the door. There was no response. He knocked again, louder this time.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Okay! Okay! I heard you! I heard you!" The sound of locks being undone, of bolts being pulled, the rattle of a chain. The red door opened a crack.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Who is it?" A man's voice, old and cigarette-roughened.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"An old friend, Czernobog. With an associate."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The door opened as far as the security chain would allow. Shadow could see a gray face, in the shadows, peering out at them. "What do you want, Votan?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Initially, simply the pleasure of your company. And I have information to share. What's that phrase?…Oh yes. You may learn something to your advantage."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The door opened all the way. The man in the dusty bathrobe was short, with iron-gray hair and craggy features. He wore gray pinstripe pants, shiny from age, and slippers. He held an unfiltered cigarette with square-tipped fingers, sucking the tip while keeping it cupped in his fist-like a convict, thought Shadow, or a soldier. He extended his left hand to Wednesday. "Welcome then, Votan."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"They call me Wednesday these days," he said, shaking the old man's hand.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A narrow smile; a flash of yellow teeth. "Yes," he said. "Very funny. And this is?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"This is my associate. Shadow, meet Mr. Czernobog."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Well met," said Czernobog. He shook Shadow's left hand with his own. His hands were rough and callused, and the tips of his fingers were as yellow as if they had been dipped in iodine.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"How do you do, Mr. Czernobog?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I do old. My guts ache, and my back hurts, and I cough my chest apart every morning."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Why you are standing at the door?" asked a woman's voice. Shadow looked over Czernobog's shoulder, at the old woman standing behind him. She was smaller and frailer than her sister, but her hair was long and still golden. "I am Zorya Utrennyaya," she said. "You must not stand there in the hall. You must go in, sit down. I will bring you coffee."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Through the doorway into an apartment that smelted like overboiled cabbage and cat box and unfiltered foreign cigarettes, and they were ushered through a tiny hallway past several closed doors to the sitting room at the far end of the corridor, and were seated on a huge old horsehair sofa, disturbing an elderly gray cat in the process, who stretched, stood up, and walked, stiffly, to a distant part of the sofa, where he lay down, warily stared at each of them in turn, then closed one eye and went back to sleep. Czernobog sat in an armchair across from them.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Zorya Utrennyaya found an empty ashtray and placed it beside Czernobog. "How you want your coffee?" she asked her guests. "Here we take it black as night, sweet as sin."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That'll be fine, ma'am," said Shadow. He looked out of the window, at the buildings across the street.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Zorya Utrennyaya went out. Czernobog stared at her as she left. "That's a good woman," he said. "Not like her sisters. One of them is a harpy, the other, all she does is sleep." He put his slippered feet up on a long, low coffee table, a chess board inset in the middle, cigarette burns and mug rings on its surface.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Is she your wife?" asked Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"She's nobody's wife." The old man sat in silence for a moment, looking down at his rough hands. "No. We are all relatives. We come over here together, long time ago."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">From the pocket of his bathrobe, Czernobog produced a pack of unfiltered cigarettes. Wednesday pulled out a narrow gold lighter and lit the old man's cigarette. "First we come to New York," said Czernobog. "All our countrymen go to New York. Then, we come out here, to Chicago. Everything got very bad. Even in the old country, they had nearly forgotten me. Here, I am just a bad memory. You know what I did when I got to Chicago?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I get a job in the meat business. On the kill floor. When the steer comes up the ramp, I was a knocker. You know why we are called knockers? Is because we take the sledgehammer and we knock the cow down with it. Bam! It takes strength in the arms. Yes? Then the shackler chains the beef up, hauls it up, then they cut the throat. They drain the blood first before they cut the head off. We were the strongest, the knockers." He pushed up the sleeve of his bathrobe, flexed his upper arm to display the muscles still visible under the old skin. "Is not just strong though. There was an art to it. To the blow. Otherwise the cow is just stunned, or angry. Then, in the fifties, they give us the bolt gun. You put it to the forehead, bam! bam! Now you think, anybody can kill. Not so." He mimed putting a metal bolt through a cow's head. "It still takes skill." He smiled at the memory, displaying an iron-colored tooth.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Don't tell them cow-killing stories." Zorya Utrennyaya carried in their coffee on a red wooden tray, in small brightly enameled cups. She gave them each a cup, then sat beside Czernobog.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Zorya Vechernyaya is doing shopping," she said. "She will be soon back."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"We met her downstairs," said Shadow. "She says she tells fortunes."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes," said her sister. "In the twilight, that is the time for lies. I do not tell good lies, so I am a poor fortune-teller. And our sister, Zorya Polunochnaya, she can't tell no lies at all."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The coffee was even sweeter and stronger than Shadow had expected.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow excused himself to use the bathroom-a closet-like room, hung with several brown-spotted framed photographs of men and women in stiff Victorian poses. It was early afternoon, but already the daylight was beginning to fade. He heard voices raised from down the hall. He washed his hands in icy-cold water with a sickly-smelling sliver of pink soap.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Czernobog was standing in the hall as Shadow came out.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You bring trouble!" he was shouting. "Nothing but trouble! I will not listen! You will get out of my house!"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday was still sitting on the sofa, sipping his coffee, stroking the gray cat. Zorya Utrennyaya stood on the thin carpet, one hand nervously twining in and out of her long yellow hair.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Is there a problem?" asked Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"He is the problem!" shouted Czernobog. "He is! You tell him that there is nothing will make me help him! I want him to go! I want him out of here! Both of you go!"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Please," said Zorya Utrennyaya. "Please be quiet, you wake up Zorya Polunochnaya."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You are like him, you want me to join his madness!" shouted Czernobog. He looked as if he was on the verge of tears. A pillar of ash tumbled from his cigarette onto the threadbare hall carpet.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday stood up, walked over to Czernobog. He rested his hand on Czernobog's shoulder. "Listen," he said, peaceably. "Firstly, it's not madness. It's the only way. Secondly, everyone will be there. You would not want to be left out, would you?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You know who I am," said Czernobog. "You know what these hands have done. You want my brother, not me. And he's gone."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A door in the hallway opened, and a sleepy female voice said, "Is something wrong?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Nothing is wrong, my sister," said Zorya Utrennyaya. "Go back to sleep." Then she turned to Czernobog. "See? See what you do with all your shouting? You go back in there and sit down. Sit!" Czernobog looked as if he were about to protest; and then the fight went out of him. He looked frail, suddenly: frail, and lonely.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The three men went back into the shabby sitting room. There was a brown nicotine ring around that room that ended about a foot from the ceiling, like the tide line in an old bathtub.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It doesn't have to be for you," said Wednesday to Czernobog, unfazed. "If it is for your brother, it's for you as well. That's one place you dualistic types have it over the rest of us, eh?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Czernobog said nothing.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Speaking of Bielebog, have you heard anything from him?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Czernobog shook his head. He looked up at Shadow. "Do you have a brother?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No," said Shadow. "Not that I know of."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I have a brother. They say, you put us together, we are like one person, you know? When we are young, his hair, it is very blond, very light, his eyes are blue, and people say, he is the good one. And my hair it is very dark, darker than yours even, and people say I am the rogue, you know? I am the bad one. And now time passes, and my hair is gray. His hair, too, I think, is gray. And you look at us, you would not know who was light, who was dark."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Were you close?" asked Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Close?" asked Czernobog. "No. How could we be? We cared about such different things."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was a clatter from the end of the hall, and Zorya Vechemyaya came in. "Supper in one hour," she said. Then she went out.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Czernobog sighed. "She thinks she is a good cook," he said. "She was brought up, there were servants to cook. Now, there are no servants. There is nothing."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Not nothing," said Wednesday. "Never nothing."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You," said Czernobog. "I shall not listen to you." He turned to Shadow. "Do you play checkers?" he asked.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Good. You shall play checkers with me," he said, taking a wooden box of pieces from the mantelpiece and shaking them out onto the table. "I shall play black."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday touched Shadow's arm. "You don't have to do this, you know," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Not a problem. I want to," said Shadow. Wednesday shrugged, and picked up an old copy of Reader's Digest from a small pile of yellowing magazines on the windowsill.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Czernobog's brown fingers finished arranging the pieces on the squares, and the game began.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">In the days that were to come, Shadow often found himself remembering that game. Some nights he dreamed of it. His flat, round pieces were the color of old, dirty wood, nominally white. Czernobog's were a dull, faded black. Shadow was the first to move. In his dreams, there was no conversation as they played, just the loud click as the pieces were put down, or the hiss of wood against wood as they were slid from square to adjoining square.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">For the first half dozen moves each of the men slipped pieces out onto the board, into the center, leaving the back rows untouched. There were pauses between the moves, long, chesslike pauses, while each man watched, and thought.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow had played checkers in prison: it passed the time. He had played chess, too, but he was not temperamentally suited to planning ahead. He preferred picking the perfect move for the moment. You could win in checkers like that, sometimes.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was a click as Czernobog picked up a black piece and jumped it over one of Shadow's white pieces. The old man picked up Shadow's white piece and put it on the table at the side of the board.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"First blood. You have lost," said Czernobog. "The game is done."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No," said Shadow. "Game's got a long way to go yet."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Then would you care for a wager? A little side bet, to make it more interesting?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No," said Wednesday, without looking up from a "Humor in Uniform" column. "He wouldn't."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I am not playing with you, old man. I play with him. So, you want to bet on the game, Mister Shadow?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What were you two arguing about, before?" asked Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Czernobog raised a craggy eyebrow. "Your master wants me to come with him. To help him with his nonsense. I would rather die."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You want to bet? Okay. If I win, you come with us."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The old man pursed his lips. "Perhaps," he said. "But only if you take my forfeit, when you lose."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And that would be?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was no change in Czernobog's expression. "If I win, I get to knock your brains out. With the sledgehammer. First you go down on your knees. Then I hit you a blow with it, so you don't get up again." Shadow looked at the man's old face, trying to read him. He was not joking, Shadow was certain of that: there was a hunger there for something, for pain, or death, or retribution.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday closed the Reader's Digest. "This is ridiculous," he said. "I was wrong to come here. Shadow, we're leaving." The gray cat, disturbed, got to its feet and stepped onto the table beside the checkers game. If stared at the pieces, then leapt down onto the floor and, tail held high, it stalked from the room.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No," said Shadow. He was not scared of dying. After all, it was not as if he had anything to live for. 'It's fine. I accept. If you win the game, you get the chance to knock my brains out with one blow of your sledgehammer," and he moved his next white piece to the adjoining square on the edge of the board.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Nothing more was said, but Wednesday did not pick up his Reader's Digest again. He watched the game with his glass eye and his true eye, with an expression that betrayed nothing.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Czernobog took another of Shadow's pieces. Shadow took two of Czernobog's. From the corridor came the smell of unfamiliar foods cooking. While not all of the smells were appetizing, Shadow realized suddenly how hungry he was.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The two men moved their pieces, black and white, turn and turnabout. A flurry of pieces taken, a blossoming of two-piece-high kings: no longer forced to move only forward on the board, a sideways slip at a time, the kings could move forward or back, which made them doubly dangerous. They had reached the farthest row, and could go where they wanted. Czernobog had three kings, Shadow had two.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Czernobog moved one of his kings around the board, eliminating Shadow's remaining pieces, while using the other two kings to keep Shadow's kings pinned down.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">And then Czernobog made a fourth king, and returned down the board to Shadow's two kings, and, unsmiling, took them both. And that was that.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"So," said Czernobog. "I get to knock out your brains. And you will go on your knees willingly. Is good." He reached out an old hand, and patted Shadow's arm with it.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"We've still got time before dinner's ready," said Shadow. "You want another game? Same terms?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Czernobog lit another cigarette, from a kitchen box of matches. "How can it be same terms? You want I should kill you twice?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Right now, you have one blow, that's all. You told me yourself that it's not just strength, it's skill too. This way, if you win this game, you get two blows to my head."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Czernobog glowered. "One blow is all it takes, one blow. That is the art." He patted his upper right arm, where the muscles were, with his left, scattering gray ash from the cigarette in his left hand.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It's been a long time. If you've lost your skill you might simply bruise me. How long has it been since you swung a killing hammer in the stockyards? Thirty years? Forty?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Czernobog said nothing. His closed mouth was a gray slash across his face. He tapped his fingers on the wooden table, drumming out a rhythm with them. Then he pushed the twenty-four checkers back to their home squares on the board.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Play," he said. "Again, you are light. I am dark."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow pushed his first piece out. Czernobog pushed one of his own pieces forward. And it occurred to Shadow that Czernobog was going to try to play the same game again, the one that he had just won, that this would be his limitation.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">This time Shadow played recklessly. He snatched tiny opportunities, moved without thinking, without a pause to consider. And this time, as he played, Shadow smiled; and whenever Czernobog moved a piece, Shadow smiled wider.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Soon, Czernobog was slamming his pieces down as he moved them, banging them down on the wooden table so hard that the remaining pieces shivered on their black squares.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"There," said Czernobog, taking one of Shadow's men with a crash, slamming the black piece down. "There. What do you say to that?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow said nothing: he simply smiled, and jumped the piece that Czernobog had put down, and another, and another, and a fourth, clearing the center of the board of black pieces. He took a white piece from the pile beside the board and kinged his man.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">After that, it was just a mopping-up exercise: another handful of moves, and the game was done.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow said, "Best of three?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Czernobog simply stared at him, his gray eyes like points of steel. And then he laughed, clapped his hands on Shadow's shoulders. "I like you!" he exclaimed. "You have balls."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Then Zorya Utrennyaya put her head around the door to tell them that dinner was ready, and they should clear their game away and put the tablecloth down on the table.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"We have no dining room," she said, "I am sorry. We eat in here."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Serving dishes were placed on the table. Each of the diners was given a small painted tray on which was some tarnished cutlery, to hold on his or her lap.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Zorya Vechernyaya took five wooden bowls and placed an unpeeled boiled potato in each, then ladled in a healthy serving of a ferociously crimson borscht. She plopped a spoonful of white sour cream in, and handed the bowls to each of them.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I thought there were six of us," said Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Zorya Polunochnaya is still asleep," said Zorya Vechernyaya. "We keep her food in the refrigerator. When she wakes, she will eat."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The borscht was vinegary, and tasted like pickled beets. The boiled potato was mealy.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The next course was a leathery pot roast, accompanied by greens of some description-although they had been boiled so long and so thoroughly that they were no longer, by any stretch of the imagination, greens, and were well on their way to becoming browns.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Then there were cabbage leaves stuffed with ground meat and rice, cabbage leaves of such a toughness that they were almost impossible to cut without spattering ground meat and rice all over the carpet. Shadow pushed his around his plate.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"We played checkers," said Czernobog, hacking himself another lump of pot roast. "The young man and me. He won a game, I won a game. Because he won a game, I have agreed to go with him and Wednesday, and help them in their madness. And because I won a game, when this is all done, I get to kill the young man, with a blow of a hammer."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The two Zoryas nodded gravely. "Such a pity," Zorya Vechernyaya told Shadow. "In my fortune for you, I should have said you would have a long life and a happy one, with many children."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That is why you are a good fortune-teller," said Zorya Utrennyaya. She looked sleepy, as if it were an effort for her to be up so late. "You tell the best lies."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">At the end of the meal, Shadow was still hungry. Prison food had been pretty bad, and prison food was better than this.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Good food," said Wednesday, who had cleaned his plate with every evidence of enjoyment. "I thank you ladies. And now, I am afraid that it is incumbent upon us to ask you to recommend to us a fine hotel in the neighborhood."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Zorya Vechernyaya looked offended at this. "Why should you go to a hotel?" she said. "We are not your friends?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I couldn't put you to any trouble…" said Wednesday.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Is no trouble," said Zorya Utrennyaya, one hand playing with her incongruously golden hair, and she yawned.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You can sleep in Bielebog's room," said Zorya Vechernyaya, pointing to Wednesday. "Is empty. And for you, young man, I make up a bed on sofa. You will be more comfortable than in feather bed. I swear."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That would be really kind of you," said Wednesday. "We accept."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And you pay me only no more than what you pay for hotel," said Zorya Vechernyaya, with a triumphant toss of her head. "A hundred dollars."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Thirty" said Wednesday.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Fifty."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Thirty-five."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Forty-five."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Forty."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Is good. Forty-five dollar." Zorya Vechernyaya reached across the table and shook Wednesday's hand. Then she began to clean the pots off the table. Zorya Utrennyaya yawned so hugely Shadow worried that she might dislocate her jaw, and announced that she was going to bed before she fell asleep with her head in the pie, and she said good night to them all.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow helped Zorya Vechernyaya to take the plates and dishes into the little kitchen. To his surprise there was an elderly dishwashing machine beneath the sink, and he filled it. Zorya Vechernyaya looked over his shoulder, tutted, and removed the wooden borscht bowls. "Those, in the sink," she told him.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Sorry."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Is not to worry. Now, back in there, we have pie," she said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The pie-it was an apple pie-had been bought in a store and oven-warmed, and was very, very good. The four of them ate it with ice cream, and then Zorya Vechernyaya made everyone go out of the sitting room, and made up a very fine-looking bed on the sofa for Shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Wednesday spoke to Shadow as they stood in the corridor.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What you did in there, with the checkers game," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That was good. Very, very stupid of you. But good. Sleep safe."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow brushed his teeth and washed his face in the cold water of the little bathroom, and then walked back down the hall to the sitting room, turned out the light, and was asleep before his head touched the pillow.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There were explosions in Shadow's dream: he was driving a truck through a minefield, and bombs were going off on each side of him. The windshield shattered and he felt warm blood running down his face.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Someone was shooting at him.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">A bullet punctured his lung, a bullet shattered his spine, another hit his shoulder. He felt each bullet strike. He collapsed across the steering wheel.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The last explosion ended in darkness.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">I must be dreaming, thought Shadow, alone in the darkness. I think I just died. He remembered hearing and believing, as a child, that if you died in your dreams, you would die in real life. He did not feel dead. He opened his eyes, experimentally.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">There was a woman in the little sitting room, standing against the window, with her back to him. His heart missed a half-beat, and he said, "Laura?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She turned, framed by the moonlight. "I'm sorry," she said. "I did not mean to wake you." She had a soft, Eastern European accent. "I will go."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No, it's okay," said Shadow. "You didn't wake me. I had a dream."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes," she said. "You were crying out, and moaning. Part of me wanted to wake you, but I thought, no, I should leave him."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Her hair was pale and colorless in the moon's thin light. She wore a white cotton nightgown, with a high lace neck and a hem that swept the ground. Shadow sat up, entirely awake. "You are Zorya Polu…," he hesitated. "The sister who was asleep."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I am Zorya Polunochnaya, yes. And-you are called Shadow, yes? That was what Zorya Vechernyaya told me, when I woke."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes. What were you looking at, out there?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She looked at him, then she beckoned him to join her by the window. She turned her back while he pulled on his jeans. He walked over to her. It seemed a long walk, for such a small room.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He could not tell her age. Her skin was unlined, her eyes were dark, her lashes were long, her hair was to her waist and white. The moonlight drained colors into ghosts of themselves. She was taller than either of her sisters.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She pointed up into the night sky. "I was looking at that," she said, pointing to the Big Dipper. "See?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Ursa Major," he said. "The Great Bear."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That is one way of looking at it," she said. "But it is not the way from where I come from. I am going to sit on the roof. Would you like to come with me?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She lifted the window and clambered, barefoot, out onto the fire escape. A freezing wind blew through the window. Something was bothering Shadow, but he did not know what it was; he hesitated, then pulled on his sweater, stocks, and shoes and followed her out onto the rusting fire escape. She was waiting for him. His breath steamed in the chilly air. He watched her bare feet pad up the icy metal steps, and followed her up to the roof.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The wind gusted cold, flattening her nightgown against her body, and Shadow became uncomfortably aware that Zorya Polunochnaya was wearing nothing at all underneath.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You don't mind the cold?" he said, as they reached the top of the fire escape, and the wind whipped his words away.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Sorry?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She bent her face close to his. Her breath was sweet.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I said, doesn't the cold bother you?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">In reply, she held up a finger: wait. She stepped, lightly, over the side of the building and onto the flat roof. Shadow stepped over a little more clumsily, and followed her across the roof, to the shadow of the water tower. There was a wooden bench waiting for them there, and she sat down on it, and he sat down beside her. The water tower acted as a windbreak, for which Shadow was grateful.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No," she said. "The cold does not bother me. This time is my time: I could no more feel uncomfortable in the night than a fish could feel uncomfortable in the deep water."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You must like the night," said Shadow, wishing that he had said something wiser, more profound.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"My sisters are of their times. Zorya Utrennyaya is of the dawn. In the old country she would wake to open the gates, and let our father drive his-uhm, I forget the word, like a car but with horses?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Chariot?'</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"His chariot. Our father would ride it out. And Zorya Vechernyaya, she would open the gates for him at dusk, when he returned to us."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And you?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She paused. Her lips were full, but very pale, "I never saw our father. I was asleep."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Is it a medical condition?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She did not answer. The shrug, if she shrugged, was imperceptible. "So. You wanted to know what I was looking at."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"The Big Dipper."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She raised an arm to point to it, and the wind flattened her nightgown against her body. Her nipples, every goose-bump on the areolae, were visible momentarily, dark against the white cotton. Shadow shivered.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Odin's Wain, they call it. And the Great Bear. Where we come from, we believe that is a, a thing, a, not a god, but like a god, a bad thing, chained up in those stars. If it escapes, it will eat the whole of everything. And there are three sisters who must watch the sky, all the day, all the night. If he escapes, the thing in the stars, the world is over. Pf!, like that."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And people believe that?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"They did. A long time ago."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"And you were looking to see if you could see the monster in the stars?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Something like that. Yes."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He smiled. If it were not for the cold, he decided, he would have thought he was dreaming. Everything felt so much like a dream.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Can I ask how old you are? Your sisters seem so much older."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She nodded her head. "I am the youngest. Zorya Utrennyaya was born in the morning, and Zorya Vechernyaya was born in the evening, and I was born at midnight. I am the midnight sister: Zorya Polunochnaya. Are you married?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"My wife is dead. She died last week in a car accident. It was her funeral yesterday."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I'm so sorry."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"She came to see me last night." It was not hard to say, in the darkness and the moonlight; it was not as unthinkable as it was by daylight.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Did you ask her what she wanted?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"No. Not really."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Perhaps you should. It is the wisest thing to ask the dead. Sometimes they will tell you. Zorya Vechernyaya tells me that you played checkers with Czernobog."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes. He won the right to knock in my skull with a sledge."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"In the old days, they would take people up to the top of the mountains. To the high places. They would smash the back of their skulls with a rock. For Czernobog."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow glanced about. No, they were alone on the roof.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Zorya Polunochnaya laughed. "Silly, he is not here. And you won a game also. He may not strike his blow until this is all over. He said he would not. And you will know. Like the cows he killed. They always know, first. Otherwise, what is the point?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I feel," Shadow told her, "like I'm in a world with its own sense of logic. Its own rules. Like when you're in a dream, and you know there are rules you mustn't break. Even if you don't know what they mean. I'm just going along with it, you know?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I know," she said. She held his hand, with a hand that was icy cold. "You were given protection once. You were given the sun itself. But you lost it already. You gave it away. All I can give you is much weaker protection. The daughter, not the father. But all helps. Yes?" Her white hair blew about her face in the chilly wind.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Do I have to fight you? Or play checkers?" he asked.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You do not even have to kiss me," she told him. "Just take the moon from me."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"How?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Take the moon."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I don't understand."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Watch," said Zorya Polunochnaya. She raised her left hand and held it in front of the moon, so that her forefinger and thumb seemed to be grasping it. Then, in one smooth movement, she plucked at it. For a moment, it looked like she had taken the moon from the sky, but then Shadow saw that the moon shone still, and Zorya Polunochnaya opened her hand to display a silver Liberty-head dollar resting between finger and thumb.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"That was beautifully done," said Shadow. "I didn't see you palm it. And I don't know how you did that last bit."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I did not palm it," she said. "I took it. And now I give it to you, to keep safe. Here. Don't give this one away."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She placed it in his right hand and closed his fingers around it. The coin was cold in his hand. Zorya Polunochnaya leaned forward, and closed his eyes with her fingers, and kissed him, lightly, once upon each eyelid.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Shadow awoke on the sofa, fully dressed. A narrow shaft of sunlight streamed in through the window, making the dust motes dance.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He got out of bed, and walked over to the window. The room seemed much smaller in the daylight.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The thing that had been troubling him since last night came into focus as he looked out and down and across the street. There was no fire escape outside this window: no balcony, no rusting metal steps.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Still, held tight in the palm of his hand, bright and shiny as the day it had been minted, was a 1922 Liberty-head silver dollar.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Oh. You're up," said Wednesday, putting his head around the door. "That's good. You want coffee? We're going to rob a bank."</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_13"></div></div></body>
