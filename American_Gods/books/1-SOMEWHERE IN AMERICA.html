<div class="calibre1"><a class="calibre5"></a><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre4">SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Los Angeles. 11:26 p.m.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">In a dark red room-the color of the walls is close to that of raw liver-is a tall woman dressed cartoonishly in too-tight silk shorts, her breasts pulled up and pushed forward by the yellow blouse tied beneath them. Her black hair is piled high and knotted on top of her head. Standing beside her is a short man wearing an olive T-shirt and expensive blue jeans. He is holding, in his right hand, a wallet and a Nokia mobile phone with a red-white-and-blue faceplate.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The red room contains a bed, upon which are white satin-style sheets and an oxblood bedspread. At the foot of the bed is a small wooden table, upon which is a small stone statue of a woman with enormous hips, and a candleholder. The woman hands the man a small red candle. "Here," she says. "Light it."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Me?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes," she says. "If you want to have me."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I shoulda just got you to suck me off in the car."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Perhaps," she says. "Don't you want me?" Her hand runs up her body from thigh to breast, a gesture of presentation, as if she were demonstrating a new product.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Red silk scarves over the lamp in the corner of the room make the light red.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The man looks at her hungrily, then he takes the candle from her and pushes it into the candleholder. "You got a light?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She passes him a book of matches. He tears off a match, lights the wick: it flickers and then burns with a steady flame, which gives the illusion of motion to the faceless statue beside it, all hips and breasts.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Put the money beneath the statue."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Fifty bucks."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes," she says. "Now, come love me."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He unbuttons his blue jeans and removes his olive T-shirt. She massages his white shoulders with her brown fingers; then she turns him over and begins to make love to him with her hands, and her fingers, and her tongue.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It seems to him that the lights in the red room have been dimmed, and the sole illumination comes from the candle, which burns with a bright flame.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"What's your name?" he asks her.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Bilquis," she tells him, raising her head. "With a Q."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"A what?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Never mind."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He is gasping now. "Let me fuck you," he says. "I have to fuck you."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Okay, hon," she says. "We'll do it. But will you do something for me, while you're doing it?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Hey," he says, suddenly tetchy, "I'm paying you, you know."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She straddles him, in one smooth movement, whispering, "I know, honey, I know, you're paying me, and I mean, look at you, I should be paying you, I'm so lucky…"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He purses his lips, trying to show that her hooker talk is having no effect on him, he can't be taken; that she's a street whore, for Chrissakes, while he's practically a producer, and he knows all about last-minute ripoffs, but she doesn't ask for money. Instead she says, "Honey, while you're giving it to me, while you're pushing that big hard thing inside of me, will you worship me?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Will I what?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She is rocking back and forth on him: the engorged head of his penis is being rubbed against the wet lips of her vulva.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Will you call me goddess? Will you pray to me? Will you worship me with your body?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He smiles. Is that all she wants? We've all got our kinks, at the end of the day. "Sure," he says. She reaches her hand between her legs and slips him inside her.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Is that good, is it, goddess?" he asks, gasping.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Worship me, honey," says Bilquis, the hooker.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes," he says. "I worship your breasts and your hair and your cunt. I worship your thighs and your eyes and your cherry-red lips…"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yes…" she croons, riding him.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I worship your nipples, from which the milk of life flows. Your kiss is honey and your touch scorches like fire, and I worship it." His words are becoming more rhythmic now, keeping pace with the thrust and roll of their bodies. "Bring me your lust in the morning, and bring me relief and your blessing in the evening. Let me walk in dark places unharmed and let me come to you once more and sleep beside you and make love with you again. I worship you with everything that is within me, and everything inside my mind, with everywhere I've been and my dreams and my…" he breaks off, panting for breath. "What are you doing? That feels amazing. So amazing…" and he looks down at his hips, at the place where the two of them conjoin, but her forefinger touches his chin and pushes his head back, so he is looking only at her face and at the ceiling once again.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Keep talking, honey," she says. "Don't stop. Doesn't it feel good?"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"It feels better than anything has ever felt," he tells her, meaning it as he says it. "Your eyes are stars, burning in the, shit, the firmament, and your lips are gentle waves that lick the sand, and I worship them," and now he's thrusting deeper and deeper inside her: he feels electric, as if his whole lower body has become sexually charged: priapic, engorged, blissful.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Bring me your gift," he mutters, no longer knowing what he is saying, "your one true gift, and make me always this…always so…I pray…I…"</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">And then the pleasure crests into orgasm, blasting his mind into void, his head and self and entire being a perfect blank as he thrusts deeper into her and deeper still…</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Eyes closed, spasming, he luxuriates in the moment; and then he feels a lurch, and it seems to him that he is hanging, head down, although the pleasure continues.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He opens his eyes.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He thinks, grasping for thought and reason again, of birth, and wonders, without fear, in a moment of perfect postcoital clarity, whether what he sees is some kind of illusion.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">This is what he sees:</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He is inside her to the chest, and as he stares at this in disbelief and wonder she rests both hands upon his shoulders and puts gentle pressure on his body.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">He slipslides further inside her.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"How are you doing this to me?" he asks, or he thinks he asks, but perhaps it is only in his head.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"You're doing it, honey," she whispers. He feels the lips of her vulva tight around his upper chest and back, constricting and enveloping him. He wonders what this would look like to somebody watching them. He wonders why he is not scared. And then he knows.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"I worship you with my body," he whispers, as she pushes him inside her. Her labia pull slickly across his face, and his eyes slip into darkness.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She stretches on the bed, like a huge cat, and then she yawns. "Yes," she says. "You do."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">The Nokia phone plays a high, electrical transposition of the "Ode to Joy." She picks it up, and thumbs a key, and puts the telephone to her ear.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Her belly is flat, her labia small and closed. A sheen of sweat glistens on her forehead and on her upper lip.</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">"Yeah?" she says. And then she says, "No, honey, he's not here. He's gone away."</span></p><p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">She turns the telephone off before she flops out on the bed in the dark red room, then she stretches once more and she closes her eyes, and she sleeps.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_9"></div></div></body>
